Among the many [Marxist police state](https://www.dcthornton.com/2008/10/30/obamas-civilian-national-security-force/) features in Obama's extra-Constitutional America is [the Civilian Security Force](https://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2008/11/obamas-plans-for-marxist-like-national.html).  (Hat tip Gateway Pundit) I'm not kidding.  


According to Obama himself this force will be [armed and funded as heavily as the US Armed Forces](https://bulletin.aarp.org/states/il/articles/obama_outlines_plan_for_national_service.html).  Unlike the Navy, Army, Air Force, and Marines, this force will aim its destructive power on political dissidents. 


"We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives that we've set," Dear Leader said Wednesday. "We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded."


These [armed Obama lovers](https://www.americanthinker.com/2008/07/obamas_civilian_national_secur.html) will enforce Obama's teaching on gay rights, abortion, redistribution of wealth, common ownership of all property and means of production, and new controls over organized religion.


I will be shopping for guns, ammo, and rosaries this week.
