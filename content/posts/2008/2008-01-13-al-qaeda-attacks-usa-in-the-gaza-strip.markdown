More of[ George Soros's buddies](https://hennessysview.com/2008/01/12/how-many-people-has-george-soros-killed/), al Qaeda, attacked an American school in Gaza tonight (US time).  [Gateway Pundit](https://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2008/01/al-qaeda-raids-us-school.html) provides:


> "Armed men entered the school in Beit Lahiya during the night and ransacked rooms as well as adminstration offices, and stole several computers."


Nasty fucks.  I'll bet George Soros finances this act of terrorism, too.


> **The raid on the school was the second in a week.** On Wednesday armed men fired anti-tank rockets at it, causing serious damage to the building.


Remember, the enemy is radical Islam--and their American puppets.
