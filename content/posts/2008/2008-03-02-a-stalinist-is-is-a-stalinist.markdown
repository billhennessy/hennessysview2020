Pay attention to this little news bit: [Chavez sends troops to Colombian border](https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23435878/).

 

Chavez is a Stalinist, and Stalin founded and expanded the Soviet Union with a combination of force, threats, and promises. Every Soviet student expects Chavez to follow suit. 

 

>   
> 
> President Hugo Chavez on Sunday ordered 10 battalions of troops to the border with Colombia after Colombia's military killed a top rebel leader.
> 
>    
> 
> He called the U.S.-allied government in Bogota "a terrorist state" and labeled President Alvaro Uribe "a criminal."

The next POTUS will have to deal with the domino theory in our own hemisphere.

 

I say we wack Chavez now. [Hot Air notes](https://hotair.com/archives/2008/03/02/is-chavez-admitting-an-alliance-with-farc/) he's endorsed FARC, if not funding the terrorists directly.
