The Catholic Church is often wrongly accused of suppressing science throughout the so-called Dark Ages. Legend has it that the Church used her secular influence over divine-right monarchs to thwart scientific inquiry.

 

It's all hooey, of course. During the Medieval period, the lack of an economic system that generated surplus left the Church alone to advance science, translate texts, and preserve history. 

 

But that's a different story.

 

Al Gore and his band of merry thought police are doing to science what the left claims the church did--slitting the throats of anyone who dares speak heresies against the Global Warming god.

 

The founder of Weather Channel, today, attacked his Frankensteinian monster for its intolerance and abandonment of science. From the [Business and Media Institute](https://www.businessandmedia.org/articles/2008/20080303175301.aspx):

"It's now for sale and there's a new owner of The Weather Channel will be announced - several billion dollars having changed hands in the near future. Let's hope the new owners can recapture the vision and stop reporting the traffic, telling us what to think and start giving us useful weather information."

"Coleman" is John Coleman who founded the channel in 1982. His network now serves as the EWTN of the World Church of Human Hatred.

> The Weather Channel has been an outlet for global warming alarmism. In December 2006, The Weather Channel's Heidi Cullen [argued](https://climate.weather.com/blog/9_11396.html) on her blog that weathercasters who had doubts about human influence on global warming should be punished with decertification by the American Meteorological Society.

If Heidi Cullen is not a heroine addict who spoke in the throes of a junk-crave, then she is a fascist who destroy science, logic, and life itself to advance the cause of this bizarre new religion founded by L. Ron Algore.

 

I get my weather from Accuweather.com. It may as fascist as The Weather Channel, but I have no evidence as yet. 

 

In the meantime, [WattsUpWithThat.com](https://wattsupwiththat.com) is the best climatology blog on the frigid planet.
