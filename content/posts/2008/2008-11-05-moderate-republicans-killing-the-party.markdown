It should be clear by now, but I figured I'd point it out: Idiots like the editors of National Review, Christopher Buckley, and Peggy Noonan need to retire. Republican moderates, including McCain, are getting their rear-ends kicked, and they're taking self-government with them.

 

The only way to defeat leftism is with hard core conservatism.

 

The debate is over.
