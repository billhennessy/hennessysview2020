Everytime I've debated the death penalty with a bleeding-heart, I've heard this question:  "Would you pull the switch" or its equal.  It's only fair to turn the question on them.

Barack Obama, if you read this blog, please answer this question:  Would you kill child who survived an abortion with your own hands?  (Thanks to [Jill Stanek](https://www.jillstanek.com/archives/2008/08/breaking_news_n_1.html) via [Michelle Malkin](https://michellemalkin.com/2008/08/11/obamas-abortion-lies/))


> Barack Obama, as chairman of an IL state Senate committee, voted down a bill to protect live-born survivors of abortion - even after the panel had amended the bill to contain verbatim language, copied from a federal bill passed by Congress without objection in 2002, explicitly foreclosing any impact on abortion.


The smartest thing about Barack Obama is his suit.  [Cassy Fiano ](https://wizbangblog.com/content/2008/08/11/change-you-can-believe-in-obama-is-pro-baby-murder.php)has the complete story and says Obama won't get out of this one.  We'll see.
