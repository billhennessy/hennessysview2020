If I read too much of what the R-and-F Dems are saying about Sarah Palin, I'll be tempted to hunt them down like dogs in the street.  But [ABC News has a blog ](https://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/08/obama-distances.html?cid=128333218#comment-128333218)with open comments, and it's worth looking at:




**Moron #1**: i just want to know who she's going to hand off her sick child to when shes off and buzzing the middle east? This is a mother's decision???? maybe the eskimo nanny...just a political puppet!

[[I told you](https://hennessysview.com/2008/08/29/democrat-hypocrisy-palins-a-bad-mother/) they were calling her a bad mother for having a career.  I'll bet James Gasowski's little woman is very familiar with the back of his hand.]




**Moron #2**:  Extremely interesting how anyone can say this woman has experience, or even more experience than the other three candidates.  

She has a bs degree in journalism, and was elected governor less than 2 yrs ago, but she has experience? At what exactly? Other than experience at having children, what else does she have experience doing???  

Where is her birth certificate? Alaska? She can't be a US citizen then, right?!  

Will she be degraded and belittled like Senator Obama? lol Of course not.  

Watch the hypocrisy flow like a muddy river.

[Alaska became a state in 1959.  Palin is 44 years old.  2008-44=1964 > 1959.  bc49's family must be thankful he didn't use his real name.]




And there are more morons where these came from, plus a lot of good conservatives and right-thinking women defending the choice or combating the elitism and sexism and racism demonstrated by the two libtards I quoted.
