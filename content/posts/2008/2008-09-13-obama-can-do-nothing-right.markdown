Yesterday, the Obama Campaign released a mean-spirited attack ad poking fun at John McCain's physical disabilities suffered in combat and as a POW in Vietnam.  The injuries left McCain unable to type on a keyboard or use computer.

But[ Democrats like to make fun of handicapped American veterans](https://michellemalkin.com/2008/09/13/obama-biden-which-disabled-war-vets-will-they-insult-next/), so they jumped all over McCain's limitations with this ad:

[Gateway Pundit](https://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2008/09/barack-obamas-attack-ad-misfires.html) has more on the nasty bastard that the Democrats call their standard-bearer.  Makes you wonder what kind of people Democrats are, doesn't it?

McCain's disability was well documented over a decade ago in the [Boston Globe](https://graphics.boston.com/news/politics/campaign2000/news/McCain_character_loyal_to_a_fault+.shtml):


> McCain gets emotional at the mention of military families needing food stamps or veterans lacking health care. The outrage comes from inside: McCain's severe war injuries prevent him from combing his hair, typing on a keyboard, or tying his shoes. Friends marvel at McCain's encyclopedic knowledge of sports. He's an avid fan - Ted Williams is his hero - but he can't raise his arm above his shoulder to throw a baseball.


When Obama said he intended to begin attacking McCain and Palin personally, I had no idea he'd stoop this low. On this point, [Obama deserves more scorn and derision](https://hotair.com/archives/2008/09/12/why-cant-mccain-email/) than any modern presidential candidate.  [And he's getting it](https://www.rightwingnews.com/#post12652).

*UPDATE*  The [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/12/AR2008091201259.html) reveals that Barack Obama is continuing to make fun of McCain's war disabilites on the stump.  What an evil son of a bitch.  I better never again hear a liberal complain about insensitive remarks from a conservative.  A liberal is only sensitive when it comes to baby killers and Islamofacsist murders.  Evil bastards.

Jonathan Weisman of WaPo, of course, cheers on Obama.  If you'd like to tell Jonathan what a panty waste he is, you can[ e-mail him here](https://projects.washingtonpost.com/staff/email/jonathan+weisman/).  If Weisman isn't in bed with Obama, then he's a crappy reporter.  Anyone can Google and learn about McCain's physical limitations.

**UPDATE**  ABC News today confirmed that McCain can't use a computer because of [war wounds](https://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/09/why-doesnt-mcca.html).  Obama campaign continuing its despicable ad.   Evil bastards. (h/t [Hot Air](https://www.hotair.com))
