[![Iran's Attack Submarine, the Ghadir](https://img.rian.ru/images/3146/74/31467416.jpg)
Iran commissioned a stealth attack submarine](https://en.rian.ru/world/20071128/89970209.html) on November 28, adding a dangerous and potentially destabilizing weapon to its aggressive arsenal. Built with Russian help, the Ghadir is capable of launching torpedoes and missiles simultaneously.

Perhaps Iran has suspended its nuke program. Perhaps not. An advanced sub patrolling the Med in the hands of Iranian nuts is bad news for that part of the world. 

Makes me wish I was still in our submarine force. I never got to fire a Snap Shot at a submerged target--but I practiced a lot.
