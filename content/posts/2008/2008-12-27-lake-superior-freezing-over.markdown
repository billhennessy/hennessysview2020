Even as CO2 levels rise, western Lake Superior is [freezing over](https://www.riverfallsjournal.com/articles/index.cfm?id=18723&section=homepage&property_id=18) for the first time years.


> The western tip of Lake Superior has frozen over in December for the first time in recent memory, and that could mean a long season of ice angling that hasn’t been seen in years.

“We were just talking that it’s been something like 17 years since we had a good, long ice fishing season at this corner of Lake Superior,’’ said Russ Francisco, owner of Marine General sporting goods store in Duluth. “This is the most ice I’ve seen in December in years. … I wouldn’t go out yet, but if it stays cold and we don’t get a big wind, people will be out there fishing soon.’’


Next question:  Has Al Gore been to Duluth recently?

Elsewhere in the AGW world, Fred Singer posts a brief but [debilitating blow](https://jennifermarohasy.com/blog/2008/12/global-warming-since-1958/) (via Jennifer Marohasy) to the AGW idiots at IPCC.  


> In conclusion: The IPCC’s ‘most’ is not sustained by observations; the human contribution is very likely only 10% or even less.


There you go.
