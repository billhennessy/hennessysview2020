Others are subtler in their descriptions, but I don't see any other way of stating the case. Yesterday, Barack Obama admitted to the Chicago Tribune that his campaigns have ac

 

cepted twice as much money from Tony Rezko than the candidate admitted in the past. 

 

Obama, the candidate of judgment, blames repeated lapses of judgment. (Perhaps his judgment is impaired only when someone has a large amount of cash.)

 

Ed Morrissey boils it down beautifully: [Either Obama lies (a lot), or Obama is very stupid](https://hotair.com/archives/2008/03/14/obama-woes-continue-at-rezko-trial/):

> Before going into business with Rezko, we're expected to believe that the president of the Harvard Law Review was so naive that he didn't read the papers or ask around about his business associate, especially when going in on a real estate deal with a man who was also a major contributor.

> Let's also take a look at that. When Obama's connection to Rezko first came to light, he initially told reporters that Rezko didn't raise any more than $50,000. Chicago reporters then dug up almost $150,000 in fundraising [last summer](https://hotair.com/archives/2008/03/09/rezko-cash-three-times-more-what-obama-admits-sun-times/), and Obama was forced to admit that he underestimated Rezko's contributions. Now he's telling us that it's over $250,000. How many more revisions on this story can he make? Will the figure get closer to a million dollars by the time November gets here?

> In both situations, the best Obama can ask us to believe is that he is a benighted idiot. He managed to attend a church with a race-baiting, America-hating pastor for twenty years without noticing it. During that time, he did business with a corrupt politico without ever noticing that, too, and he blithely went from election to election without being able to tell the difference between $50,000 and $250,000.

I have noticed [Obama's propensity to lie](https://hennessysview.com/2008/03/01/so-obama-lies/), to cover, to deny, and to blame others for some time. As these character flaws reveal themselves, Obama's weakness as a candidate becomes obvious. His complete lack of qualifications for President are almost frightening.

 

The media could have vetted Obama a year or even four years ago. They didn't. Instead, they ordained him the Great Black Hope and hoped no one else would notice. The media--CNN, CBS, ABC, NBC, New York Times, Washington Post, LA Times, and a hundred others--ignored or covered up any potential flaws or weaknesses in Obama. [Greta Van Susteren notes](https://gretawire.foxnews.com/2008/03/15/new-senator-obama-poll-vote-now/) that, even today, the NYT has buried the story, hoping not to embarrass the man the LA Times calls "[The Magic Negro](https://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-ehrenstein19mar19,0,5335087.story?coll=la-opinion-center)." Apparently, these people didn't expect he'd be in a tight race against Clinton Inc.

 

 

UPDATE: Then, again, maybe Obama really isn't all the smart. Take a look at these two statements from one interview Obama gave yesterday ([AP](https://apnews.myway.com/article/20080315/D8VDI3H00.html)):

 

>   
> 
> Rezko helped raise up to $250,000 for his various political races, Obama's campaign said. The campaign had previously put the figure at $150,000 but now says that amount was only for his 2004 Senate race.

Okay. So you lied about the money. Now, this . . . 

 

>   
> 
> "He never once asked me for any favors, _or ever did any favors for me_," the Illinois senator said in an interview with the Chicago Sun-Times. "He never gave me any gifts or gave me any indication he was setting me up to ask for any favors in the future."

Please, someone, send me $250K. I will NOT consider it favor.
