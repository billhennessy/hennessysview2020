In an interview certain to shock Democrats who believe Bill Clinton a paragon of truthfulness and honesty, Democrat candidate Barack Obama has accused Bill Clinton of lying, according to [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=4162996&page=1).


> "You know the former president, who I think all of us have a lot of regard for, has taken his advocacy on behalf of his wife to a level that I think is pretty troubling," Obama said. "He continues to make statements that are not supported by the facts -- whether it's about my record of opposition to the war in Iraq or our approach to organizing in Las Vegas.


Who knew?  Obama goes on to reveal more Clinton's nasty little secret:


> "This has become a habit, and one of the things that we're going to have to do is to directly confront Bill Clinton when he's making statements that are not factually accurate," Obama said.


On MY Vast Right Wing Conspiracy, [Martin ](https://bamapachyderm.com/archives/2008/01/20/their-race-is-more-fun-than-ours/)points out that Obama never uses the 'L' word.  He goes on to aptly describe Clinton's ignorance of honesty:


> Become a habit? Are you kidding me? Lying is in the Clinton’s DNA. He doesn’t even know when he’s lying. She’s no better. Their lives are all lies, their marriage is a lie, their self-image is a lie. They lie to themselves and to each other. They lie to each of us, all the time.


Later in the week, Obama plans to reveal more bad stuff 'bout Democrats, including:



	  * Hillary Clinton is a bitch
	  * John Edwards is shallow
	  * Joe Biden claims to have written the Bible, A Tale of Two Cities, and The Catcher in the Rye

Stay tuned.  [WizBang ](https://wizbangblog.com/content/2008/01/20/barack-obama-finally-acknowledges-what-republicans-have-always-known-about-the-clintons.php)noticed that Obama noticed that Bill Clinton is running for President, not for first lady.  Powerful stuff from [Kyle E. Moore ](https://commentsfromleftfield.com/2008/01/bill-clinton-go-the-fuck-home)on Comments From Left Field:


> Maybe Mr. Clinton should have followed the lead set for him by the presidents of the past and not gotten so close to his wife’s campaign.


Barack Obama and Kyle are not the only Democrats who sick of Bill Clinton.  The new issue of Newsweek carries a story titled "[Leading Democrats to Bill Clinton: Pipe Down](https://www.newsweek.com/id/96385)": (h/t [Michelle Malkin](https://michellemalkin.com/2008/01/19/dems-to-bill-clinton-shut-up/))


> Prominent Democrats are upset with the aggressive role that [Bill Clinton](https://www.newsweek.com/related.aspx?subject=Bill+Clinton) is playing in the 2008 campaign, a role they believe is inappropriate for a former president and the titular head of the Democratic Party. In recent weeks, Sen. Edward Kennedy and Rep. Rahm Emanuel, both currently neutral in the Democratic contest, have told their old friend heatedly on the phone that he needs to change his tone and stop attacking [Sen. Barack Obama](https://www.newsweek.com/related.aspx?subject=Barack+Obama), according to two sources familiar with the conversations who asked for anonymity because of their sensitive nature. Clinton, Kennedy and Emanuel all declined to comment.


Where were all the Democrats when Clinton was President?  He lied and divided just as much then.  He set the stage for 9/11 and, with his wife, tried to take over 1/7 of the entire economy.  He traded national security secrets for campaign contributions and molested an intern.  And these lefties, who now wish he'd shut up and go home, applauded his every sin.
