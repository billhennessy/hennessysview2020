Obama's support plummeted overnight, despite the MSM's "see no evil" act regarding [Tony Rezko](https://hennessysview.com/2008/03/15/obama-admits-he-lied-about-rezko/) and [Jeremiah Wright](https://hennessysview.com/2008/03/14/its-only-wrong-if-youre-caught/).

 

> It's Obama 46% Clinton 45%** **([see recent daily results](https://rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/election_20082/daily_presidential_tracking_polling_history)). This reflects an unusually sharp change from yesterday's results when Obama led by eight points and reached the 50% level of support for the first time.

 

That's really bad news for Obama. If either of these stories ever reaches the front pages of a newspaper, he might need to work on his withdrawal speech.

**UPDATE** Wander over to [RealClearPolitics](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/national.html) to see the latest head-to-head numbers. McCain now leads Obama and is tied with Hillary. Apparently, the Democrat racism-sexism bloodbath isn't playing in Peoria.
