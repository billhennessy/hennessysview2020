Not entirely my fault.  


I planned to vote on my way home from work.  I have a client-facing job, and I have to respond to production issues.  Tonight's issue lasted until 6:10.  Then, either local flooding or a bad accident had a major road to my house closed.  It took over 45 minutes to get through the detour.   By that time, it was 7:00 p.m., and my polling place in Ellisville, Missouri, was closed. 


I apologize to everyone.


I would have voted for Romney.
