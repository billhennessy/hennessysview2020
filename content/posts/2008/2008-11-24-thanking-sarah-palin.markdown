I received this e-mail this morning and thought I'd share it.

Both CNN and CNN International contacted us for interviews on the subject. The Wall Street Journal ran an online report as did the publication Advertising Age. MSNBC is conducting an interview with our spokesman, Mark Williams, on Monday morning.

> Before we do, we wanted to let you know we need to raise just $50,000 more to fund our TV ad buy to thank Gov. Sarah Palin and defend her from all the attacks that continue to be launched against her. It's obvious our efforts are striking a nerve, and those who are afraid of Palin's appeal to America are determined to smear and destroy her. We must fight back in honor of this dynamic, uplifting and passionate conservative leader.

The commercials seem wholly positive and thankful, not angry; exuding happiness is one of the key behavioral changes conservatives MUST MAKE if we're to return to power in the United States.

 

I am not affiliated with the group in any way, but I like their message.
