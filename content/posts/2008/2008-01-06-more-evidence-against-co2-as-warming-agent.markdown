I have been railing against idiots who think human activity causes global warming for years.  I find it interesting, then, that the more evidence we get the I'm right, the more people believe that I'm wrong.

The latest evidence comes brilliantly from [Jeff Jacoby ](https://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2008/01/06/br_r_r_where_did_global_warming_go/)via Boston Globe.  Some of the facts:



	  * Temperatures have been flat since 2000, even though CO2 in the atmosphere increased 4 percent
	  * 2007, predicted by all alarmist models to be the hottest in recent history, was not
	  * The second half of 2007 was one of the coldest in recent times
	  * Ice in Antarctica is growing rapidly for the first time in 6,000 years
	  * Al Gore is an idiot

There.  Five undeniable truths that refute the greenhouse theory.  Any questions?

Here's some highlights from Jacoby:


> "Carbon dioxide is not to blame for global climate change," [Sorokhtin writes](https://en.rian.ru/analysis/20080103/94768732.html) in an essay for Novosti. "Solar activity is many times more powerful than the energy produced by the whole of humankind." In a [recent paper for the Danish National Space Center](https://www.spacecenter.dk/publications/scientific-report-series/Scient_No._3.pdf/view), physicists Henrik Svensmark and Eigil Friis-Christensen concur: "The sun . . . appears to be the main forcing agent in global climate change," they write.


I blogged Sorokhtin's article [earlier this week](https://hennessysview.com/2008/01/03/instead-of-global-warming-global-reality/).


> Yet so relentlessly has the alarmist scenario been hyped, and so disdainfully have dissenting views been dismissed, that millions of people assume Gore must be right when he insists: "The debate in the scientific community is over."

But it isn't. Just last month, more than 100 scientists signed a [strongly worded open letter](https://www.nationalpost.com/most_popular/story.html?id=164002) pointing out that climate change is a well-known natural phenomenon, and that adapting to it is far more sensible than attempting to prevent it. Because slashing carbon dioxide emissions means retarding economic development, they warned, "the current UN approach of CO2 reduction is likely to increase human suffering from future climate change rather than to decrease it."


So piss off a [global warming idiot ](https://hennessysview.com/2008/01/01/global-warming-in-2008/)today by embracing the thing they hate the most:  science.  Cracker Barell Philosopher has done so and discovered another nugget of truth about the coming [global freeze](https://countrystore.blogspot.com/2008/01/save-your-carbon-credit-cash-global.html).  And if you were panicked by the global warming nonsense, you should be very concerned about the global cooling:


> When asked about what this will mean to the average person on the street, [Director of the SSRC] Casey was firm. “The last time this particular cycle regenerated was over 200 years ago. I call it the “Bi-Centennial Cycle” solar cycle. It took place between 1793 and 1830, the so-called Dalton Minimum, a period of extreme cold that resulted in what historian John D. Post called the ‘last great subsistence crisis.’ With that cold came massive crops losses, food riots, famine and disease. I believe this next climate change will be much stronger and has the potential to once more cause widespread crop losses globally with the resultant ill effects. The key difference for this next Bi-Centennial Cycle’s impact versus the last is that we will have over 8 billion mouths to feed in the next coldest years where as we had only 1 billion the last time. Among other effects like social and economic disruption, we are facing the real prospect of the ‘perfect storm of global food shortages’ in the next climate change. In answer to the question, everyone on the street will be affected.”
