The massive storm brewing out west will plunge [Los Angeles](https://www.weather.com/weather/tenday/USCA0638?from=monthAvgGraph_topnav_undeclared) into the 30s, threatening all-time record lows for that city. Seattle is looking at highs in the mid-20s for the week ahead. That's cold. Amazingly, the Ottawa Weather Center predicted this blast last week ([here](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2008/12/09/rare-50-year-arctic-blast-sets-sights-on-southern-california/) and [here](https://www.owsweather.com/ows.html)).

Meanwhile, to the east and north or Southern California, blizzards will extend from [New Mexico to Minneapolis](https://www.weather.com/maps/maptype/forecastsusnational/ussnowfallforecast_large.html?from=36hr_winterstrmwarn). The cold and snow is forecast to continue for the next 48-72 hours, striking St. Louis and Chicago Sunday evening through Tuesday.

This weather comes from Siberia where daily highs have been -80 F for the past few days. Apparently, there's not much CO2 in Russia.

Meanwhile, the AGW freaks insist that Congress take over the auto industry to save the planet. I assume they want to save the planet from another ice age.

[Anthony Watts](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2008/12/13/something-is-rotten-in-norway-500000-sq-km-of-sea-ice-disappears-overnight/#more-4514) has discovered more fraud by the global warming nuts, this time involving Arctic sea ice.

> This morning I was shocked to discover that overnight, huge amounts of sea ice simply disappeared. Fortunately I had saved the images and a copy of the webpage last night. Here is the before and after in a blink comparator:

The criminals at [NANSEN](https://arctic-roos.org/observations/satellite-data/sea-ice/ice-area-and-extent-in-arctic) didn't like the fact that Arctic sea ice was about to exceed the 1979-2000 average. So they changed the numbers. What a bunch of lying criminals. Here's the e-mail address of the criminal master mind: [stein.sandven@nersc.no](mailto:stein.sandven@nersc.no).

Meanwhile, take a look at yesterday's satellite images of the North Pole and judge for yourself. On the right is yesterday's ice. On the left is 12/12/1980, one of the coldest winters in the past 40 years.
