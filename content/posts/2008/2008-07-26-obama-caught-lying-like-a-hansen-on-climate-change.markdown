[TigerHawk ](https://tigerhawk.blogspot.com/2008/07/fact-checking-barack-obama-on-climate.html)decided to fact-check Obama's pontifical address to his German subjects concerning the messiah's "facts" about global warming (h/t [Hackbarth](https://www.theamericanmind.com/)).  Like Hansen and Gore, Obama enjoys lying to the people. 

TigerHawk shows academic research that report sea levels falling, not rising, and Kansas not in a drought, but normal to exceptionally moist.

I'm not surprised to catch [Obama in a lie](https://hennessysview.com/2008/03/01/so-obama-lies/); I am surprised that people continue to lie about global warming despite all scientific evidence (not doctored by[ James Hansen](https://hennessysview.com/2008/07/23/dr-james-hansen-of-giss-is-a-liar-and-a-fraud/)) to the contrary.
