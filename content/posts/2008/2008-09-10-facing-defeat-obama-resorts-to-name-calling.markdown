[Obama called Sarah Palin "a pig" today](https://hotair.com/archives/2008/09/09/obama-on-mccainpalin-you-can-put-lipstick-on-a-pig-but-its-still-a-pig/).  I guess we know, now, how he responds to pressure.

Reasonable people's opinions of the messiah were already on the down slope, but his resorting to name-calling should pretty much assure his defeat.

He took the time to disguise the insult:  "You can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig," the Democrat said, referring to Palin's famous ad lib that the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull is the lipstick. (Michelle [cracks back](https://michellemalkin.com/2008/09/09/you-botched-the-joke-barry-o/).)

Obama's sophomoric behavior should give undecided voters caution.  There's no doubt that he would not have resorted to low-brow tactics were it not for the polls.  McCain's surge of 20 points in a week threaten to put the election out of reach.  Even California and New York are now in play for McCain and Palin: a scenario considered ridiculous when the Dems were praying that the God they don't believe in would annihilate New Orleans through Hurricane Gustav.

Obama's incivility followed [Low Blow Joe Biden's](https://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/09/biden.special.needs/index.html) insinuation that Sarah Palin's Down Syndrome baby is moral retribution for Republican opposition to Democrat dreams of harvesting stem cells from murdered babies--a practice Biden supports even if it involves murder.

Obama and Biden are beneath contempt.   Perhaps they should appear on the Jerry Springer Show.

**UPDATE**  It's amazing how up-in-arms the moonbats get when their boys are caught acting like morons in public over something trivial, but how silent they become when [Obama's quasi-legal influence peddling](https://hennessysview.com/2008/09/08/obama-the-property-of-freddiefannie-crooks/) with Fannie Mae executives.   

**UPDATE** I missed the interview with O'Reilly tonight, but watched on [Gateway Pundit](https://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2008/09/disaster-barack-obama-gets-chewed-up.html).  What a pathetic, lying, idiot Obama is.  Are you liberals as stupid as he is, or do you like terrorists, racists, and socialists? The Pundit's points:


> He could not defend or explain his associations with terrorists, racists, and Leftist nutjobs.
He couldn't defend his decision to appease the Daily Kooks.
He compared Sean Hannity and FOX News to the vile nutroots radicals.
He excused Bill Ayers' terrorist attacks.
He could not name one example where FOX News smeared him.
He could not name one conservative friend.
Obama was _so bad _that O'Reilly started laughing.


Meanwhile, Glenn Reynolds points out that the "lipstick" meme from Democrats is[ too frequent to be coincidence](https://www.pajamasmedia.com/instapundit/archives2/024095.php).  Duh.  It's called a "talking point."    Sorry, moonbats:  your defense of your candidate falls short of convincing.
