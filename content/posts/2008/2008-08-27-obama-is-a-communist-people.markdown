[Michelle Malkin](https://michellemalkin.com/2008/08/26/gloves-off-now-obama-calls-for-prosecuting-gop-donor/) reports that Barack Obama has asked the US Justice Department to incarcerate a Republican donor in Texas for the high crime of . . . donating money to Republicans.

This guy is as red as Stalin.  Don't think for a moment that, if  Obama wins, the RNC's donor list will be scrutinized and big donors prosecuted.

Communists don't like competition.  

Stop him before he stops you.
