Tomorrow's USAToday ([online now](https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2008-09-07-poll_N.htm)) carries the latest Gallup Poll of Likely Voters.  McCain-Palin opened a 10-point lead over Obama-Biden in the first poll conducted completely following the GOP convention.


> In the new poll, taken Friday through Sunday, McCain leads Obama by 54%-44% among those seen as most likely to vote. The survey of 1,022 adults, including 959 registered voters, has a margin of error of +/— 3 points for both samples.


Expect the Dems to go berserk over this news.  Accusations, half-truths, innuendo, and outright lies will fly.  Expect talk of dumping Biden for Clinton to pick up on the lefty blogs and among more serious Democrats and campaign people.

Among all registered voters, the lead is 50-46, still outside the poll's margin of error.
