[Daily Kos](https://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2007/1/31/11112/2465) won't be too happy with the Biden choice.

ABC News's Jake Tapper spent his Saturday morning documenting some of Joe Biden's dumbest moments. [(It's long.)](https://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/08/joe-bidens-mout.html)  My favorite came from a Biden 1988 campaign ad in which he seemed to anticipate Obama's candidacy:


> "The White House isn't the place to learn how to deal with international crisis, the balance of power, war and peace, and the economic future of the next generation," [**said a TV ad for Sen. Joe Biden's 1988 presidential campaign**](https://www.4president.us/tv/1988/biden1988bio.htm).  "A President has got to know the territory, but that's not enough."


Ed Morrissey documented [Biden's list of lies ](https://hotair.com/archives/2008/08/21/obamabiden-for-the-arrogance-ticket/)that helped derail his own campaign in 1988.

Rush Limbaugh on Friday lamented news (of the hour) indicating the Biden would NOT be the choice.  I wish Rush were on today--last I heard was Rush offering a prayer that the reports were wrong and Obama would pick Biden.

For my part, I see Biden's selection as evidence that the Dems don't think Obama is man enough to win this thing.  They went for stability, but went with a liberal Senator from and eastern state.  Not exactly a diverse ticket. 

Obama was on the path to a rather embarrassing defeat before the announcement of a veep.  I see nothing in Biden's selection to alter that momentum.
