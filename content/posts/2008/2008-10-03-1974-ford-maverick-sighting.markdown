Today's my dad's 84th birthday.  I went to see him and my mom after work.  My sisters Mickey and Tee showed up, and Tee's husband Gary.  We drank some Budweisers and laughed.

I headed home about 7:30.  As I turned left off of Germania onto Gravois, an orange (not original color) 1974 Ford Maverick made a right off Hampton right in front of me.  It took a second for my mind to make the connection.  Maverick.

I took it as a good omen.

I heard the first question of the debate on the radio in my car.  Palin's answer, following Biden's, was good.  On TV she was even better.  

Others will dissect the debate, so I'll stay with impressions.  

Biden was the better debater.  Palin won.  Biden lied or was factually wrong on 10 points.  Palin was factually wrong on none.  Biden never stumped Palin, but Palin perplexed Biden once and decisively.  I don't remember the question, the answer, or the subject, but it sent Biden stammering like his hero, Obama.

The winning line was Palin's shoutout to her brother's 3rd graders at some elementary school who get extra credit for watching the debate.  Killer.  No career politician would think of it.  No squirrel like Obama could pull it off.

It was a 100 percent victory for the mom from Wasilla. She overplayed the privilege of answering the previous question, but that doesn't matter.  She was nails.  she connected.  [Frank Lutz's independent](https://hotair.com/archives/2008/10/02/luntz-focus-group-palin-in-a-blowout/)s move from undecided to McCain by a 9 to1 margin because Palin was money.  

Money.  That's her new name.  [Sarah is money](https://). So money.

Peggy Noonan was on 97.1 FM in St. Louis this morning.  She didn't expect much from Sarah Palin in the debate.  Tonight Peggy admitted she was wrong.
