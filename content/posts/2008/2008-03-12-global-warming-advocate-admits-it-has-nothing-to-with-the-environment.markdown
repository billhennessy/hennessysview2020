We on the right have claimed for years that environmentalist extremists (Al Gore, et al) are motivated by socialism, if not totalitarianism. In our argument we contend that scientific proof has no meaning to these miscreants. They are bent on economic and political control, not a healthy eco-system. 

 

If you don't believe us, maybe you'll believe one of them.

The climate crisis is a powerful tool to motivate change - like checking the ever-expanding global population and excessive resource consumption - and if the urgency of climate change is compromised, other environmental projects may fall by the wayside.

No need for the left to deny what what we've known all along. Global warming is lef

 

tist politics, not science. It is totalitarianism, not ecology. is socialism, not conservation. 

 

It's nice to hear the totalitarians admitting their collectivist aims. It's chilling that they are so emboldened.
