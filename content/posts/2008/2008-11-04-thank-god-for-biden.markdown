My mother told me to always find the good in a bad situation.

 

If Obama wins, we'll have 4 years of knee-slapping, chin-rattling, crisis-causing gaffes from the silliest candidate for high office since . . . Quayle? 

 

In today's episode, [Joe explains](https://elections.foxnews.com/2008/11/03/biden-offers-girls/) than Nancy-girls could kick Nancy-boys' asses. Or something like that. Well, no, his sister's a "girl-boy" and girl-boys are tougher than girl . . .

 

Screw it. I have no idea what he was trying to say, but I'd defend with my laugh his right to say it!
