Senator and VP candidate Joe Biden today broke from the DNC and from Barack Obama declaring his belief that life begins at conception, according to the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/08/us/politics/08campaign.html?_r=1&hp&oref=slogin).

 

Biden must have a very difficult time reconciling that belief with his public support of abortion rights. If he truly believes that life begins at conception, supporting abortion under and circumstances is tantamount to advocating murder.

 

Biden admits that he cannot fully reconcile the two opposing views:

 

>

> In the interview Sunday, Mr. Biden tried to walk the line between the staunch abortion-rights advocates in his party and his own religious beliefs. While he said he did not often talk about his faith, he said of those who disagree with him: "They believe in their faith and they believe in human life, and they have differing views as to when life -- I'm prepared as a matter of faith to accept that life begins at the moment of conception."

Biden's revelation could make abortion a major topic in the campaign. Clearly, his moral views are in line with those of McCain and Palin and miles apart from Obama's belief that even a child who survives a botched abortion should be killed on the spot.

 

At least this issue isn't above Biden's pay grade.

 

This could be the last straw. Pro-abortion zealots will demand [Obama drop Biden](https://hennessysview.com/2008/09/06/the-post-palin-electoral-college-map/) from the ticket. Combined with the polls, [Obama might listen](https://hennessysview.com/2008/09/07/holy-hockey-mom-mccain-double-digits-with-likely-voters/).

 

This story will grow legs.
