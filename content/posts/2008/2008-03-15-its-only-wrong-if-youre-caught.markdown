](https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/06obama-lg.jpg) In a pathetic admission of his own shallowness, Barack Obama admitted that he's known since his campaign began that the Rev. Jeremiah Wright is an anti-US racist. According to [Fox News](https://elections.foxnews.com/2008/03/14/obama-calls-chicago-pastors-fiery-remarks-inflammatory-and-appalling/):

 

>   
> 
> Obama said he never personally heard Wright preach the statements at the center of the controversy, but he first learned of them when he launched his presidential campaign.
> 
> 

 

For almost a year, Obama has defended the bigot, naming him chairman of the African-American Spirtitual Leadership Committee for his campaign. Tonight, he issued this attempt at damage-control:

 

>   
> 
> I categorically denounce any statement that disparages our great country or serves to divide us from our allies. I also believe that words that degrade individuals have no place in our public dialogue, whether it's on the campaign stump or in the pulpit. In sum, I reject outright the statements by Rev. Wright that are at issue.
> 
> 

 

Great. But why didn't this denunciation come a year ago when Obama admits he first learned that his pastor of 20 years is an anti-American racist? Why did Obama knowingly put a racist on his campaign committee? Why did he defend the miscreant time and time again? Why, only yesterday, did his campaign state that Rev. Wright would remain on the campaign? Here's Obama's weak answer:

 

>   
> 
> He said he did not leave the congregation upon learning of Wright's more divisive remarks, because of his "strong links" to the church, where he married his wife and where his daughters were baptized.
> 
> 

 

The would-be President has "strong ties" to a racist, anti-American ass-hat. Great. This is the best his party can come up with? 

 

Obama wants us to judge him on his judgment. So far, his judgment involves [consorting with alleged felons](https://blogs.abcnews.com/theblotter/2008/03/rezko-played-bi.html) and admitted US-haters. He's married to an anti-American bigot. And he didn't denounce his pastor's bigotry until the press found out about it.

 

Obama shows the judgment of a coward seeking to win the White House by hook or crook.

 

UPDATE: [Patterico Pontificates](https://patterico.com/2008/03/14/obama-heres-whats-important-and-i-dont-have-it/) on Obama's judgment.

 

UPDATE II: One of my favorite blogs, [Discerning Texan](https://discerningtexan.blogspot.com/2008/03/vdh-welcome-to-politics-of-change.html), has a fantastic long piece on Obama's revealing attempt to distance himself from Wright. Obama could be finished before Pennsylvania.

 

Beginning tomorrow, you will see the greatest flood of liberal lies and spin you've every seen in your life. The left will go after Bill O'Reilly more viciously than they attacked Rush Limbaugh. By next week, anti-Fox legislation will come up in Congress.
