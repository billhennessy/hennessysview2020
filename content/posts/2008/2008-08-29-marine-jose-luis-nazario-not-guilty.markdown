The Marine who was [charged in civilian court ](https://hennessysview.com/2008/08/17/free-jose-luis-nazario-jr/)with murder for doing his job on terrorists in Iraq was found NOT GUILTY (h/t [wizbang](https://wizbangblog.com/content/2008/08/28/breaking-former-marine-found-not-guilty-on-iraqis-deaths.php)) by a jury of his peers.

Congratulations to Jose Luis Nazario!  Thank you, Marine, for you proud and noble service to me, my family, and our country.  Thank you, jurors, for rejected the sick arguments of that jack-booted thug federal prosecutor. 

May this serve as a warning to anti-military prosecutors.  The jury system prevails.

**UPDATE**
More news on the trial available.  From [FoxNews](https://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,413005,00.html):



> One of the jurors, Ingrid Wicken, hugged Nazario's sobbing mother, Sandra Montanez, without speaking after the verdict was read. "I watched her all week. She was being tortured every day," Wicken said later.

Wicken said the panel acquitted Nazario because there was not enough evidence against him.

"I think you don't know what goes on in combat until you are in combat," she said.
