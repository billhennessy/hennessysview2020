[Drudge](https://www.drudgereport.com) has posted two headline: Obama + 15 in Pennsylvania (where Black Panthers and election judges made sure no Republicans could actually vote), and SENATE: DEMS SEE 58 SEATS; EXIT POLLS SHOW OBAMA BIG

I wouldn't make too much of it, though. Urban area tend to dump more data at the mid-day collection than suburban and rural areas do. [Remember that in 2004](https://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,137451,00.html), the media all but called Ohio for Kerry at 3:00 in the afternoon based on exit poll results.

Nor would I read too much into reports of Obama supporters getting [urgent text messages](https://marcambinder.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/11/minnesota.php) saying that the race was closer than they expected and directing them to call phone numbers to take part in a last-ditch GOTV effort (h/t [Hotair](https://hotair.com/)). [The text was probably real](https://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2008/11/obamedia-alert-minnesota-significantly.html), but it was also written and scheduled in Obama's CRM system a month ago. It would have gone out even if McCain had dropped out of the election on Friday.

So, for a little while, America remains a semi-free, quasi democracy.

UPDATE: [McCain](https://www.usnews.com/blogs/capital-commerce/2008/11/4/pethokoukis-mccain-stocks-soaring.html) pollster positive on Florida, upbeat overall
