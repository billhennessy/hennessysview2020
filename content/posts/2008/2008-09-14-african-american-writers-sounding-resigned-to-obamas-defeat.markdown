The African-American press has decided to help Obama by threatening all-out race war in America if McCain wins. In other words, vote for Obama or die. 

 

Last week, Fatimah Ali, a radical black writer, wrote in the Philadelphia News that if McCain wins, there will be a full-scale race war.

In Sunday's Washington Post, [Randall Kennedy](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/12/AR2008091202414_2.html?hpid=opinionsbox1), also African-American, hinted at racial violence if Obama loses.

This conclusion will be accompanied by bitter disappointment, and in some quarters, stark rage.

So much for appealing to people's greatest hopes.

 

I feel for Mr. Kennedy. His closing paragraphs are both touching and sad. He seems resigned to the fact that Obama will lose and that, in losing, will prove to many a symbol of failure for blacks in America.

 

I feel sorry for him and for other blacks who will be devastated by Obama's loss: not because they "deserve" a black President--[no one deserves an identification President](https://wizbangblog.com/). But because the first African-American to win his party's nomination was unquestionably the wrong guy. Obama is weak and flawed. He was rushed into the position, and he wasn't ready.

 

I wish I could say that I understand how Kennedy feels. I can't, of course. I'm white and Irish and Catholic. But there will be a black President, and he or she will be the right one. Providence has a way of visiting upon America the leader we need at just the right moment. The 90s were perfect for Clinton--nothing to do but steer the ship. The 80s perfect for Reagan--a Cold War needed to end and our self-esteem needed a boost. Carter allowed Reagan to win. Bush 43 had the cold anger to push Islamofascist terrorism to the brink of extinction. Roosevelt reassured Americans and might have prevented all-out communism from taking hold in America.

 

I hope there isn't a race war on November 5. But I won't vote Democrat just because it's threatened. Nor would I vote Democrat out of guilt or to make Kennedy feel better about himself. That's like letting someone win a game of one-on-one. No one deserves that kind of insult.
