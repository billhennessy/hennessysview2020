Charlie Gibson extracted an insubordinate clause from a sentence spoken by Sarah Palin with the intent of accusing her of knowing God's mind. Gibson did this intentionally, lied intentionally, misled intentionally. [His a fraud, a cheat, and a liar](https://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2008/09/abc-news-flops-on-palin-interview.html).

 

Palin said this:

 

>   
> 
> Pray for our military men and women who are striving to do what is right. Also, for this country, that our leaders, our national leaders, are sending [U.S. soldiers] out on a task that is from God. That's what we have to make sure that we're praying for, that there is a plan and that that plan is God's plan.

Smugfuck Gibson's version:

 

>   
> 
> our national leaders, are sending [U.S. soldiers] out on a task that is from God. There is a plan and that that plan is God's plan. 
> 
> 

 

Somebody should rearrange Charlie Gibson's teeth.
