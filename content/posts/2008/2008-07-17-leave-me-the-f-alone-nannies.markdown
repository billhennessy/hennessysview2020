It took the nanny-staters to more than a minute to scream at low-carb dieters like me about the Mediterranean Diet study released today.

The study shows that Atkins-like, low-carbohydrate diets are the most effective kind for both weight loss and good health.  That joys me, because the only way I can lose and keep of weight is with low carbs.  Even when I was running half marathons, I was well over 200 lbs on a 6-1 frame.  That's really hard on the tendons and joints.  I landed on my back for a week with an Achille's tendon so inflamed the doctor thought it would rupture walking from his office to my car.

But the nanny worriers--the people who insist on telling me what to eat, smoke, drink, think, wear, and fondle--immediately blasted the study with a bunch of crap arguments, like this one from [The Spartan Diet ](https://thespartandiet.blogspot.com/2008/07/mediterranean-diet-research-deeply.html)blog:


> subjects get an alcohol point for consuming from one to three glasses of alcohol for men and slightly less for women. That means drinking zero alcohol -- the healthiest option, assuming the rest of your diet is healthy -- is treated the same as drinking a bottle of scotch every day. The upper end of this scale -- _three glasses per day_ -- is enough to develop chronic alcoholism.  [Emphasis mine]


Three friggin' glasses a day is chonic alcoholism????   That would make me . . . Dean Martin!

I'm sure the writer has a product to hawk, but leave it alone.  I'm not on the Med Diet, but it sounds like a great way to save some people from diabetes, heart disease, and 48-inch waists.

The American Heart Association has good but non-commital things to say about the Med diet [here](https://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4644).  Eric of [Health and Survival Blog](https://hennessysview.com/wp-admin/A bigger surprise: The low-carb diet improved cholesterol more than the other two. Some critics had predicted the opposite.)--a committed-sounding name if I ever heard one--found that low carb diets lower cholesterol better than low fat diets.  So there.

Go read it for yourself on the [New England Journal of Medicine.](https://nejm.org)
