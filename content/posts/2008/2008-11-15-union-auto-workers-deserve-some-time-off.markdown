A federal bailout for the Big Three auto manufacturers will be direct transfer of wealth from the middle class to the upper class. Auto workers are, by Joe Biden's definition, "wealthy."

[Union auto workers](https://mjperry.blogspot.com/2007/07/uaw-pricing-themselves-out-of-market.html) more than the average executive manager with an MBA and nearly 3 times the wage of the average teacher with a master's degree. That's why the Big 3 are dying, and that's exactly what the unions deserve. (Hat tip, [Econopundit](https://econopundit.com/))

[Gateway Pundit provides](https://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/) this chart showing the extravagant auto worker salaries.

American auto workers make almost 160 percent of Japanese auto workers wages. And the Japanese produce better cars.

UAW's time has passed. Big Union's greed has destroyed more jobs in America than anything that's happened on Wall Street. Let's let the UAW workers eat cake for a while.
