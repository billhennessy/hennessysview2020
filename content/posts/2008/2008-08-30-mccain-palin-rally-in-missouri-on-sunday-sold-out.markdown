On Thursday, the Washington Post gleefully reported that the GOP couldn't give away tickets to McCain's scheduled pre-convention rallies in Dayton, Ohio, Pittsburgh, PA, and [O'Fallon, MO](https://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/Calendar/Detail.aspx?guid=7e3e276c-018b-4b9b-a41e-55b97ad107fe).

That ended with the announcement of Palin as is VP choice.

In St. Louis, tickets disappeared so quickly (and the distribution method was so lame-brained) that even donors and party activists with guaranteed reservations lost their reservations. The party decided to give away reserved tickets to meet the clamorous demand at the doors of various ticket locations (which is going to royally piss off my son Patrick when he finds out they gave away our tickets).
