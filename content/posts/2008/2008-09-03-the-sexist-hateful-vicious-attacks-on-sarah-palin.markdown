Not my words, there, but those of Susan Estrich, Democrat feminist, speaking on FoxNews. Estrich specifically identified the hateful sexists as "my friends." She thoroughly and unquestionably denounced everything that's come from Washington Post, New York Times, [US magazine](https://michellemalkin.com/2008/09/02/pds-alert-us-magazines-partisan-hit-job/), and [Barney Frank](https://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2008/09/leading-democrat-sarah-palins-family.html)
