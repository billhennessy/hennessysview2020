I just sent a copy of "Hard Corps: From Gangster to Marine Hero" to Berkeley, California, Mayor Tom Bates.  After all the anger directed at Berkeley after its city council voted to declare our great Marines _persona non grata_, I figured, "Maybe these people are just ignorant."

So I'm teaching the mayor to read, and what.  If you'd like to educate other members of the council, find their names and addresses [here](https://hennessysview.com/2008/02/03/give-berkeley-to-taliban/).

Also, [Black Five reports ](https://www.blackfive.net/main/2008/02/us-marines-winn.html)that two Berkeley council members have introduced a bill to rescind the letter to the Marines that started the fight.  Good for them.  Your pressure worked!
