Where's Tony Soprano when the world needs him?

 

There's a [communist instigator in Venezuela](https://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2008/03/not-just-ecuador-chavez-paid-farc-300.html) who needs to assume the position and take the big sleep. [HotAir](https://hotair.com/archives/2008/03/03/colombia-chavez-gave-300m-to-farc-terrorists/) has more.

 

Whack him, W. Then take out the Ecuadorian government, as well.
