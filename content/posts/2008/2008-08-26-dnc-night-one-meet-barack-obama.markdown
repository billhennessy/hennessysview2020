Make me puke.

After 10 months of 24 x 7 Obama news, after the Washington Post, [Tom Brokaw, and Ed Rendell](https://www.politico.com/blogs/michaelcalderone/0808/Rendell_Obama_coverage_was_embarrassing.html) admitted that Obama coverage is embarrassingly lavish, after an 8-to-1 newspaper inch advantage over John McCain, these idiot Democrats have the balls to stand there and tell us that Americans just don't know Obama well enough!

The last guy who was so friggin complex that it took a decade to "know him" was Richard Nixon!  Do we really want to go through _that_ again.

Well, maybe if it's a Democrat declaring, "I'm not a crook."
