Baby, it's cold outside. Are you cold tonight?

 

I thought it was just me. Here in St. Louis, we've had a few way above average temp days this winter, including 70+ in January and February. But between those balmy days are many, many below average days and nights. My gas bill has been in over $200 a month, and I live in an 11-year-old, well insulated home.

 

Now, we learn that the polar ice caps have reversed five years of shrinkage by returning rapidly old levels. From the [Daily Express](https://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/35266/Global-warming-It-s-the-coldest-winter-in-decades):

_Damn. All that worry and rancor shot to hell. _

 

Now, the idiots will tell us that record cold temperatures and increasing ice caps prove global warming is real. Just remember--they're idiots.
