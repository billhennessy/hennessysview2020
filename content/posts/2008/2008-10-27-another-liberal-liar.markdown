Black Five has the story of cowardly, pussy, scum who's pretending to be a military hero. I know his kind of talk is frowned upon, but [Charlie W. Williams](https://www.blackfive.net/main/2008/10/another-fake-so.html) should be taken out and shot. The best we can hope for in our wimpy society is for a Marine to beat the living hell out of him. The fact that he's an old man makes no difference: you pretend to be a war hero for political purposes, you get whatever comes to you. Whatever whatsoever.

 

Then, again, liberalism judges heroics by the costumes.
