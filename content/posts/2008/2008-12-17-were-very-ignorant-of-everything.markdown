Anthony Watts runs [one of the most fascinating web sites](https://wattsupwiththat.com/) on the entire internet. If you don't read it every day, you're missing a great, free education. 

 

Two stories today illustrate his Nobel-worthy work:

 

    * The [Ionosphere](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2008/12/16/earths-ionosphere-drops-to-a-new-low/) is encroaching on our atmosphere, perhaps because    [the sun seems to be dying](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2008/12/14/even-quieter-on-the-solar-front-another-all-quiet-alert-issued/)** The Earth's [protective magnetic field](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2008/12/16/earths-magnetic-field-has-massive-breach-scientists-baffled/) has a massive breach allowing solar winds to bombard us with space stuff  

Both stories illustrate our minute understanding of our planet, its atmosphere, our solar system, the universe, and God. In relative terms, James Hansen and Stephen Hawking know no more than a 2-year-old idiot-Savant.

 

When someone tells you--someone with nine impressive abbreviations following his surname--that man-made global warming will kill all the polar bears and [destroy the North Pole](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2008/12/14/gore-entire-north-polar-ice-cap-will-be-gone-in-5-years/) in five years unless we ban smoking, beef, and barbecues tomorrow, smile and remember that, despite what you learned in Physical Science 204, we don't even know what magnetism is. 

 

If scientists cannot account for the sun, then they will never account for man's influence on climate.

 

We are more ignorant than ants. And [Tom Nelson](https://tomnelson.blogspot.com/) is the master at pointing out the ignorance of Captain Planet's platoon.
