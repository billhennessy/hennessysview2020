The day after John McCain handed Barack Obama his ass on a platter at the Saddleback Forum, Obama's paid mouthpiece, Andrea Mitchell, accused McCain of cheating (see [Newsbusters](https://newsbusters.org/blogs/d-s-hube/2008/08/17/nbcs-andrea-mitchell-floats-idea-mccain-cheated)).  I guess going mano-a-mano with a real man is [above Obama's paygrade](https://hennessysview.com/2008/08/17/obamas-an-idiot-on-abortion/), too.

How pathetically consistent.  Barack Obama's childishness, immaturity, and lack of accountability grow to new legendary heights every passing day. 

I really don't know how people can take this brat seriously.  He lies like a rug, he cries like a baby when things don't go his way, he cannot form[ a coherent English sentence ](https://wizbangblog.com/content/2008/08/17/obama-deciding-when-a-baby-gets-human-rights-is-above-my-pay-grade.php)unless it's written, rehearsed, and printed on a teleprompter.  He has accomplished nothing except for carefully following the scripts of his handlers his entire life.  You can bet he was the recipient of grade inflation for minorities throughout college. 

A few months ago, I found myself sort of liking Obama.  That was when I first started looking at him as a possible nominee for the Democrats.  Day by day, though, I have come to loathe this childish bastard.  His smarminess, his conceit, his phoniness.  He's as fake a porno movie orgasm and half as orginal.

Barack Obama might well be the worst candidate every nominated by a major party--George McGovern and Walter Mondale included.

UPDATE:  [McCain campaign calls out NBC's ](https://www.politico.com/news/stories/0808/12594.html)Andrea Mitchell as an Obama hack, NBC News as a partisan ad agency for the DNC.  Get 'em John!

UPDATE II:  [Michelle Malkin's ](https://michellemalkin.com/2008/08/18/sore-loser-obama-and-obamedia-accuse-mccain-of-cheating/)mocking of The Obama is a classic.  Wizbang's [Kim Priestap ](https://wizbangblog.com/content/2008/08/17/obama-campaign-accuses-mccain-of-cheating-andrea-mitchell-dutifully-carries-obamas-water.php)is flabbergasted that Andrea Mitchell and Obama can be this childish.
