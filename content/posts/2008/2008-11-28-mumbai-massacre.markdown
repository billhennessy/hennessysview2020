Vietnam was the first televised war. Film from the morning was flown one-stop to California allowing Americans to witness action within 24 hours of its occurrence.

 

The Gulf War upped the ante with live, streaming video, 24 hours a day on CNN.

 

September 11 and the liberation of Iraq came with live blogging from people feet from the action.

 

But reading text messages on [Twitter from people on the streets of Mumbai](https://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23mumbai) as events unfold is truly bizarre. The interaction between people in Mississippi and citizen journalists on the streets of Mumbai provides a level of personalization unimaginable only 3 years ago.

 

Look at this, all from within the last 60 seconds:

 

#### Realtime results for **#mumbai**

 

##### 6 more results since you started searching. [Refresh](https://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23mumbai) to see them.
