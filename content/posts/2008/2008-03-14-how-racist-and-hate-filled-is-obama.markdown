If I said my favorite writer is Adolf Hitler and that my wife hates America, you might legitimately call me an anti-American bigot.

 

Barack Obama's wife is unabashedly anti-American. His spiritual advisor is more so. That advisor, the Reverend Jeremiah Wright, hates white people, too. When the person with whom you choose to live your life and the person from whom you seek guidance for your thoughts and actions are known anti-American bigots, people are justified in assuming you are like them. You chose them. You defend them. You must agree with them. Right?

 

On Christmas Day, Rev. Wright told his congregation, "God damn America." Barack Obama might as well open his next stump speech with Garrett Morris's song from that Saturday Night Live skit: "I'm gonna get me a shotgun and kill all the whities I see."

 

You won't hear about this on the evening news, though. The big media are doing their damnedest to cover up this black supremicist's comments as they seek to realize his hope, depsite [Patterico's](https://patterico.com/2008/03/13/8297/) expectation that this would be lead off news.

 

If Rev. Wright is willing to publicly and on video tape lead his congregation in a chant of "God _damn_ America," how bold do think his advice to Obama has been? And if Obama denounces, in his heart, the Reverend's sermons, then why did Obama retain Wright as his spiritual advisor for 20 years?

 

Now, you can say that a politician can compartmentalize his moral beliefs (in this case, racist) from his political beliefs. But would you trust a politician who routinely supports political ends he believes are morally wrong? Do you trust the politician who goes to church every Sunday but defies the teachings of his church? Don't we call them hypocrites? And if they are not true to God speaking through their spiritual advisors, will they be true to their constituents?

 

 

 

Christians choose a spiritual advisor in the belief that the Holy Ghost will speak through that advisor, providing insights into thought and action. Thought and action. What advice did the Rev. Wright give Obama over these 20 years? What advice does Wright provide Obama's campaign as its official spiritual advisor?

 

[Michelle Malkin](https://hotair.com/archives/2008/03/13/video-obamas-pastor-takes-highly-nuanced-approach-to-racial-divisiveness/) sees the same connection I do, and points out that Obama the Hypocrite likes calling white people racists for saying things that are not racist at all. Obama is a bigot. As terrible is this sounds, a vote for Obama is vote to punish white people.

 

The bad news is that I and everyone who reaches the unavoidable conclusion presented here will be labeled a racist. Every single one. That's because most white elites in education, media, and politics, still view blacks as ignorant, weak, flawed creatures who need protection from the normal. In the liberal's mind, blacks can never be left to sink or swim on their own--they're just too stupid. For the party of [Jim Crow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws) and George Wallace, slavery never died--it changed its name to Affirmative Action.

 

The media and the Obama campaign are now trying to distance themselves from Wright--only two days after announcing Wright will be the full-time spiritual advisor to his campaign. Even [CNN](https://www.cnn.com) notes:

 

>   
> 
> Obama and Wright have been close for years. Obama has been a member of Wright's church since his days in law school, and Obama's best-selling book, "The Audacity of Hope," takes its title from one of Wright's sermons.

But judge for yourself who the racists are.

 

From Fox News:

But some of you bought that "hope" crap Obama's been spewing.

UPDATE: Right now, [The O'Reilly Factor](https://www.foxnews.com/oreilly/index.html) on Fox News is tearing up the MSM for purposefully ignoring this story. Key point from media analyst Bernie Goldberg: "Most reasonable people would not be a member of that church." Bingo. He went on to say, "I have never it [the media] this corrupt."
