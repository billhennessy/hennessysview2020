[Jenn Q Public](https://www.jennqpublic.com/) asked [if I'd heard t](https://hennessysview.com/2008/12/13/historic-winter-storm/)hat Al Gore--the man Don Imus described as Evil Incarnate--told a German audience that the North Pole will cease to exist in 5 years. He held up his hand, fingers splayed, to avoid any possible confusion.

Mark the date: according to Gore, on 12/12/2013, there will be zero ice north of the Arctic Circle. This would an amazing change in trends since global sea ice has been [growing for 20 years now](https://noconsensus.wordpress.com/2008/12/14/glolbal-sea-ice-increased-over-28-years/). (h/t [Tom Nelson](https://tomnelson.blogspot.com/2008/12/glolbal-sea-ice-increased-over-28-years.html))

 

If he's wrong, let's sue him. Here's how. We'll set up a PayPal account to raise money to build a Jet Ski resort in Barrow, Alaska. The big bucks will to R&D of the lighting system to allow people to Jet Ski during months with zero sunlight.

 

If there's ice in January, that will seriously hurt business. Since we based our business on a guarantee from Gore, he'll be liable for our loses. We'll sue him, not only for our lost investment, for 20 years of revenue.

 

Of course, if Al Gore is not a liar and a fraud, he could always sue me.
