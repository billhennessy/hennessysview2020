Holy crap! That was the best speech McCain ever delivered. It was heartfelt and powerful. It was moving. It was . . . remarkable.

And it reminded me of a great reason to celebrate. Let me explain.

I was born in 1963 when there were still "Colored" and "White" drinking fountains. Obama's a few years older. 

Tonight, despite my best efforts and many others, we have a black President. That's amazing in a very good way.

If there's a silver lining in this election, it's this: America is now a color-blind society. Martin Luther King must be smiling, not for Obama's election, but for America's maturity.

God bless America.
