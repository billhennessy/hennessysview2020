Two polls--[Zogby](https://www.zogby.com/news/ReadNews.dbm?ID=1548) and [Gallup](https://elections.foxnews.com/2008/09/07/gallup-daily-poll-gives-mccain-largest-margin-since-ma-over-obama/)--now have John McCain and Sarah Palin leading Barack Obama and Joe Biden by 4 and 3 percentage points, respectively. Both leads are beyond the margins of error.

 

Clearly, the voters like what they see in McCain and, especially, Palin. These results also validate the idea that Democrat lies and smears aimed at Palin are actually helping the GOP ticket.

 

As a result of these numbers, Barack Obama has abandoned the traditional, academic definition of recession, and breaking another promise to his far left supporters: he will extend the Bush tax cuts in order to help the economy.

 

Yes, that's right. Obama is now a [supply sider](https://elections.foxnews.com/2008/09/07/obama-recession-could-delay-end-to-bush-tax-cuts/). He has acknowledged that tax cuts spur economic growth, and that tax increases on top earner could plunge the economy into a depression.

 

On InTrade, McCain continues to close in on Obama:

The confused young man, though, indicated he still plans to create an economic depression:
