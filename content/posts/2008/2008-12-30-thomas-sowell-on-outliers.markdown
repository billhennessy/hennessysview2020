I bought "Outliers" the day it hit the bookstores for one reason:

1.  Malcolm Gladwell is the best researcher-writer alive today.

I declared the book the most important in a generation.  People made fun of me. 

Well, [Thomas Sowell](https://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NzRiMmU4NWEzMTMzOWY0OThhMmE4MGEwMjg5M2E4YjA=) comes close to echoing my reaction:


> This book is an outstanding achievement in itself, and its readability, insights, and imagination make it one of the best books of 2008 or any other year.


Read Sowell's review if you haven't read the book.  Or skip the review and just read the book.
