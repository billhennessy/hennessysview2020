[Ignorance is no defense](https://newzeal.blogspot.com/2008/10/obama-file-41-obama-was-new-party.html).

 

Americans, faced with the choice of [Marxist-socialism](https://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/election/452) or republican-capitalism, a plurality chose [communism](https://conservababes.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=2041). 

 

Their moral weakness, combined with viral corruption of character, has created a majority coalition of indecisive morons known as independents, children who want government to make their decisions and butter their bread, and [neo-Marxists, like Obama](https://www.theminorityreportblog.com/hinzsight_story/david_hinz/2008/10/24/throwing_around_the_socialist_word_barack_obama_was_a_member_of_the_chicago_dsa). We fought the Cold War for nothing.

 

Over the next two years, we will see the most [complete change in a nation](https://tadcronn.wordpress.com/2008/10/24/obama-nation-socialist-paper-names-obama-as-member/) seen since the Bolshevik Revolution nearly 100 years ago in Russia:

 

    * Obama names [Bill Ayers Secretary of Education](https://billayers.wordpress.com/2006/11/)** [Carbon-taxes](https://online.wsj.com/article/SB122445812003548473.html) based on the pseudo-science of anthopogenic global warming will [bankrupt the coal industry](https://michellemalkin.com/2008/11/02/audio-obama-will-bankrupt-the-coal-industry/)** [Electricity rates will skyrocket](https://newsbusters.org/blogs/kerry-picket/2008/11/02/obama-energy-prices-will-skyrocket), forcing the federal government to nationalize the electrical power generation and distribution industry** Obama's minions in Congress will purge the Democrat party of moderates. Charges of "corruption" will lead to abandonment by the White House and Democrat party leaders. Joe Lieberman will high on this hit list** The government will take over the auto industry in the US in order to "save it." Auto workers will be come government employees** Obama will announce that, due to continued economic and financial problems, the US government will permanently maintain ownership of banks** Electricity rates will be based on income and usage, allowing those above Obama's arbitrary line of wealth to pay the electric bill those below the line** Iran and Iraq will fight a short, brutal war which Iran will win after the US withdraws in 6 months** In March 2009, the US Congress will pass a sweeping "reform" of the military, cutting military spending 25 percent, eliminating most new weapons systems in development, and forcing the retirement of most flag officers so Obama can appoint friendlier faces** Either by replacing retiring Justices or by expanding the Court to 15 Justices, Obama will turn the Supreme Court in his personal rubber stamp** The US will sign non-aggression pacts with [Venezuela](https://venezuela-usa.blogspot.com/2007/07/obamas-first-mistake-on-dealing-with.html), [Cuba](https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/2007-08-22-cuba-stance_N.htm), and [Iran](https://origin.barackobama.com/issues/foreign_policy/) obligating the US to refrain from action against those countries** Unemployment will rise in fits and starts, eventually reaching 12 percent late in 2009** Congress will overhaul the unemployment system, granting permanent benefits** Congress will reinstate numerous entitle programs eliminated by the Contract with America and Bill Clinton** Late in 2009, Congress will create the [National Civilian Security Force](https://www.americanthinker.com/2008/07/obamas_civilian_national_secur.html) (NCSF), part of the Department of Homeland Security and authorized to investigate, arrest, and prosecute anyone suspected of crimes against the people** Congress will pass legislation requiring federal registration of all [privately owned fire arms](https://townhall.com/columnists/JohnSigler/2008/10/31/obamas_gun-restriction_policy_playbook) and authorizing the NCSF to perform unannounced inspections of the homes of fire arms owners and those suspected of owning unregistered weapons** Congress will re-enact the "[Fairness" Doctrine](https://www.heritage.org/research/regulation/em368.cfm), making it far more onerous than the last one; Rush Limbaugh and Michael Savage will retire in the face of mounting legal bills and NCSF prosecutions** Iran will conquer Israel after a blitzkrieg of missile and heavy artillery. Israel's cries for help will go unanswered as Obama cites the non-aggression pact signed with Iran** In 2010, the NCSF will arrest George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, and Donald Rumsfeld, charging them with [crimes against humanity](https://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/attytood/Barack_on_torture.html). A war crimes court will be established at the Hague. In July 2010, Rumsfeld and Bush will be handed over to the court for incarceration.** The worsening economic depression will make internet access unaffordable for most people, driving the government to nationalize the internet, regulating content and bandwidth** The Supreme Court will refuse to hear an appeal from a ruling that declares the Catholic church in violation of sex discrimination laws. The church will have 180 days to ordain and recognize a woman "priest." After the church refused to comply, all church property was seized and priests ordered into service as chaplains for the NCSF.
