Despite promises from Barack Obama that his campaign would drop attacks on its Republican rivals during Hurricane Gustav, that [walking hunk of excrement](https://elections.foxnews.com/2008/09/01/biden-skips-labor-day-parade-to-monitor-hurricane/), Joe Biden, broke the promise and ripped into John McCain today during a stump speech.


> The only guy in America in a position of some authority who is out of sync with the whole rest of the world is John McCain.

Earlier in the day, Biden skipped out on a planned appearance at Labor Day parade in Pittsburgh, Pa., saying,  “I think it’s totally appropriate that elected officials march here in Pennsylvania, but it shouldn’t be a day for national politics,”he said.


I'd like to punch that s.o.b. in the nose.
