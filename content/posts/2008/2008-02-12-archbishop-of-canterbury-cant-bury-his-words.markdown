Last week, Rowan Williams, the idiot who presides over the Anglican church, made comments on the radio that his country should adopt Islamic law.   Today's [Washington Post ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/11/AR2008021102783.html?hpid%3Dtopnews&sub=AR)reports that Williams sticks by his sentiments in favor of the abolition of freedom and Christianity, but like so many spineless weasels in today's public eye, Williams says he'd made a "misleading choice of words." 

A man stupid enough to emit such utterances could not possibly benefit from my attacks: his stupidity is beyond human reach. 

He might, however, solve many problems by returning to the Mother Church and leaving behind childish things like Anglicanism and Islam.

Worse for us, a President Obama would give Williams cheer by adopting the Sharia law in our country.

[Michelle Malkin](https://michellemalkin.com/2008/02/09/resign-archbishop-of-dhimmitude/) has much more, including Williams's past verbal atrocities.
