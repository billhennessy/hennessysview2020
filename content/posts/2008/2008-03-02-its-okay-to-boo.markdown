Disks ping-pong across the floor*
while Polar Bears dance on steel stilts*
and the teacher in a JFK suit*
tells his failing pupils all is well. All is well.

 

All isn't well in the theatre, though.*
All is tight, worried and sad. Foreboding.*
The clock's ticks annoy the voyeurs*
who stand in nervous circles, smoking.

 

The patient may not have the year.*
The doctors may not have the room.*
The semester may be out of quarters*
before the class learns to add and subtract.
