There are two reasons to [read this column](https://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2008-10-27/sarah-palins-a-brainiac/1/), every inch, every delicious letter, comma, period, semi-colon, and sidebar.

 

First--

 

Elaine Lafferty former editor-in-chief of Ms. magazine, has spend a lot of time around Sarah Palin and found her remarkable. Palin smart and has great . . . instincts.

 

Second--

 

Read the first comment by an idiot woman named mariah. Mariah was frightened by Palin's "McCarthy"-like warning that, if Obama is elected, Mariah's property will be in jeopdy. 

 

Does Mariah not read what Obama says? What does Mariah believe "redistributive justice" means? What could it possibly mean other than "from each according to his means; to each according to his needs?"
