Apparently Bush's plan to socialize all of America before leaving the White House is alive and well.  Some sort of a [crappy deal has been reached](https://www.chicagomag.com/core/pagetools.php?pageid=7444&url=/Chicago-Magazine/February-2008/Mr-Un-Popularity/&mode=print).

The plan includes a car czar--something that Toyata, Nissan, and Honda miraculously do not need--to run the auto industry like a DMV license office.  

The last time a government designed, built, and sold an automobile like, it was called the Yugo.  I'll keep my SUV, thanks.

Once again, our [last hope is the Republican Caucus](https://michellemalkin.com/2008/12/09/yes-more-voices-for-a-gop-filibuster-of-the-uaw-bailout/)--this time in the Senate.  Write today.
