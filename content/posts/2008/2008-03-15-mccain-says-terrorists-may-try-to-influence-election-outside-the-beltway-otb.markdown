James Joyner takes note of John McCain's statement that al Qaeda may try to influence the US election to avoid a McCain administration. 

 

> it's not entirely clear why al Qaeda is so desperate to avoid a President McCain. I suppose there's some propaganda value to a female president that could be exploited; if anything, the opposite would be true in the case of a President Obama. Do they envision a radically more terrorist-friendly foreign policy?

I say, "Yes." Obama would provide a friendly environment for terrorism. So would Hillary, but only to a point.
