Demonstrating a remarkable daftness for thinking on his feet, Barack Obama magnified the folly of a debate gaffe, today, in a clumsy rejoinder to John McCain's response.

 

In a debate, Obama said he would deploy troops back into Iraq, after a pullout, if al Qaeda established bases. (Do I really need to point out the lack of intelligence, understanding, and strategy his comment portrays?)

 

McCain responded by saying, "I have news for Senator Obama, al Qaeda is in Iraq, and that's why we're fighting in Iraq."

Actually, Senator, before we invaded Iraq, al Qaeda was in Manhattan killing your Democrat opponent's constituents.

 

Such details escape the junior Senator from Illinois, though. Messiahs don't sweat the small stuff. 

 

The best shot in this debate came from W himself:
