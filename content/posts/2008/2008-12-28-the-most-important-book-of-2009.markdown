I just finished “The Power of Less” and its companion ebook, “Thriving on Less.” I hope everyone–and I mean everyone–reads these books before the end of January.

Why are these books so important? Because life changed in 2008. The commitments we’d made as individuals, families, communities, nations, and the world received a margin call. We had biggest margin call in history, and everyone from plumbers to Harvard MBAs (especially the MBAs) lacked the capital to pay the bill.

As a result, we can feel something unsettled inside of us. There’s a voice telling us to slow down, to demand better instead of more, to raise our standards for living.

“The Power of Less” crystallizes those murky feelings into clear, undeniable truths. You cannot read the book without realizing–on page one–that you have too much stuff on your desk, in your house, on your mind, and in your life. And most of that stuff has little value or quality.

Congratulations, Leo Babauta, and thank you. You have given me direction. Many others will surely follow.

**UPDATE** Leo Babauta has launched the 30 day[ Power of Less Challenge ](https://zenhabits.net/2008/12/make-2009-great-join-the-power-of-less-new-years-challenge/)at ZenHabits.com.  Instead of making a New Year's resolution (or 9) that you'll forget about before the Arizona Cardinals win the Super Bowl, try this challenge.  The idea seems sound to me, and it's helped Leo become a productivity guru.    My new habit?  Exercise.  I've been off the treadmill (and weight bench) for over a year.  Since I quit smoking in November, the size 42 waist won't be far behind unless I get moving.
