The Senate will vote on[ Socialism for Billionaires II](https://michellemalkin.com/0208/09/30/flash-senate-bailout-vote-scheduled-tomorrow-at-approx-9pm-eastern/) tomorrow night at 9:00 p.m. Eastern.  TELL YOUR SENATOR TO VOTE NO!

One-third of the Senate is up for re-election this year.  Make sure they all know that a vote for the bailout is a vote for unemployment.  

I've written Senators Bond and McCaskill.  You need to let yours know that you like 485-point Dow advances, and you don't want Congress screwing up our bull market.  

Socialism is no way to run a democracy.  Tell your Senator NO!
