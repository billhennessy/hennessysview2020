Last weekend, news of [Canada's "Human Rights" Commission's](https://hennessysview.com/2008/01/12/al-qaeda-in-cananda-attacked-by-publisher/) persecution of a magazine publish sent a frightening chill through her freedom-loving neighbors to the south (US) and through many of her own good citizens.

This week, we learn that some [Canadians continue their persecution](https://www.nypost.com/seven/12162007/postopinion/editorials/canadas_thought_police_72483.htm) of conservatives, Christians, and free-speakers.

Right Wing News has the story of  a blogger called before an Islamic council to answer for his crimes--printing excerpts of a [Mark Steyn](https://www.freemarksteyn.com/) [book](https://www.nypost.com/seven/12162007/postopinion/editorials/canadas_thought_police_72483.htm).  It seems that Canada has outlawed speech--written or oral--that any Muslim finds uncomfortable.  Sort of like the Nazis, isn't it?  Or Kabul under the Taliban?

At the risk of pissing off an entire country, not to mention the one that produces some of my favorite hockey players, perhaps we should stop pretending Canada to be a democracy.  It's much closer to an Islamic Republic.
