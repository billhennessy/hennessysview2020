According to Stanley Kurtz, one of a handful of reports allowed to see the Ayers Papers at University of Illinois, Chicago, "Our worst fears were confirmed."  

Radical terrorist [William Ayers](https://elections.foxnews.com/2008/08/26/obama-associate-bill-ayers-unrepentant-for-acts-of-terror/), founder of the [Weathermen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weatherman_(organization)) and the Woods Fund of Chicago, appointed Obama as one of three directors of the "education" project in 1995.  In exchange for the appointment and the right use it as street cred in his first political campaign, Obama voted to siphon funds intended for public school education programs into Ayers's radical political organizations.

In the end, the Woods Fund of Chicago was an abject failure.  Education in Chicago's schools got worse, not better.  Obama won his Illinois Senate race and went on to become his party's nominee for president.  Ayers remains at large.
