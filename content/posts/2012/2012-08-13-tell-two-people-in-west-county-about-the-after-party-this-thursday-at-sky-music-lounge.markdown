A friend from Dallas just called me.  He said he met two conservatives from Ballwin who’d  love to be involved in movement conservatism . . . but don’t know how.

I was shocked. And a little embarrassed. ** How can someone in West County not know about St. Louis Tea Party Coalition and The After Party?**  '

Clearly, I’ve done something wrong.  I’m sorry.  But I can’t just throw my hands up and walk away.

We’re STILL fighing against Obamacare.  We’re STILL fighting against government growth.  We’re still fighting for a Constitutional Republic. We’re still fight FOR the American Ideal.  And we’re still the Tea Party, dammit!

So here’s the help I need from you. ** Bail me out.  Please.  **

**Don’t assume anyone knows anything**.  Tell them to come to **Sky Music Lounge on Kehrs Mill at Clayton Road in Ballwin, MO, this Thursday.  Arrive before 7:00 to get a great seat. **

Bring strangers.  They don’t have to be Tea Partiers.  They don’t have to be registered voters.  They don’t have to be Republicans.  They just have to be open to the ideas of liberty, freedom, fiscal responsibility, and national defense.

**We have a special badge for the first 100 people—commemorating 12 months of After Parties. **

With Paul Ryan on the ticket, with the election 90 days away, with the conventions about take over TV and the news, with the USA dominating the medal count at the Olympics™, I’d be shocked if Sky Music Lounge wasn’t overflowing on Thursday.  Shocked and disappointed.  And embarrassed.

**The next Tea Party After Party is this Thursday, August 16, at Sky Music Lounge in Ballwin.  [Here’s the map.](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=sky+music+lounge&hl=en&ll=38.607515,-90.565045&spn=0.008786,0.021136&fb=1&gl=us&hq=sky+music+lounge&cid=0,0,14725699772350072745&t=m&z=16&iwloc=A)**
