While everyone was screaming about the rising cost of medical treatment, **America’s leftist incubation chambers—colleges and universities**—robbed us of our economic future. And the federal government’s misguided student aid program is to blame.

**What allows this growth? **   * Increased per student government funding   * Massive private and public debt

**Who benefits?**   * College administrators   * Unions working on college campuses   * Political causes that college administrators like (liberal)

**Who pays?**   * Taxpayers (who else?)

Check out these statistics:   * **College tuition increased 799%** between 1978 and 2007 ([source](https://seekingalpha.com/article/144835-college-tuition-explaining-the-increases))   * Student loan debt has increased 511% since 1999 ([source](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/08/chart-of-the-day-student-loans-have-grown-511-since-1999/243821/))   * Government per student increased 246% between 1978 and 2007   * In the past 20 years, **college tuition has increased about twice as fast medical costs**   * **The education bubble makes the housing bubble look like a pimple ([source](https://www.mymoneyblog.com/charts-college-tuition-vs-housing-bubble-vs-medical-costs.html))**   * Recent college graduates are no smarter than graduates of 40 years ago (observation)

On that last point, I’m not alone. From [contraryinvesting.com, Brett writes](https://contraryinvesting.com/entrepreneurship/the-roi-of-higher-education-questioned-and-exposed/):

> Did this increase in spending do any good? Not on the available evidence. Test scores — measuring achievement — have not budged in 40 years. In other words, the additional investment over the last 40 years has been wasted. We might as well have thrown the money down a well.

Read Brett’s piece in its entirety. The arguments _against_ everyone going to college are important. [Seth Godin raised similar questions](https://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/04/the-coming-meltdown-in-higher-education-as-seen-by-a-marketer.html) in 2010.

> _Most colleges are organized to give an average education to average students._

There is great value in a college education, but not at any price. Not when the lifetime economic value of an education is about to become a net negative. According to the rating agency Moody’s:

> Unless students limit their debt burdens, choose fields of study that are in demand, and successfully complete their degrees on time, **they will find themselves in worse financial positions and unable to earn the projected income that justified taking out their loans in the first place**."
>

Personal finance coach [Dave Ramsey shows families](https://www.daveramsey.com/article/saving-for-college-is-easier-than-you-think/lifeandmoney_college/) how a child can complete a 4-year degree without a penny of debt. But that formula might not work today. **Tuition has gone up 16 percent in the two years since I first heard of Ramsey’s plan.**

So what’s Obama’s prescription?

You guessed it: **Obama wants more government spending. More borrowing. More forgiveness of debt. **

While some on the right want to vilify students, in most cases, I disagree. Kids born near or after me grew up with “college education” pounded into our heads.

“You’ll be _nothing!_ without a degree,” we heard.

We scorn people who don’t go to college. (Look at the recent flap involving St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley.)

**But the government has encouraged colleges to drive their costs through roof**. For years, the federal government promised to fill the gap between what a student could afford (according to the government) and what a college charged.

Seriously. What if the government made the same deal with car buyers? 

The solution isn’t simple. There’s a big bubble in the higher education market, and it has to burst. Families, students, and governments have no more money to lend. The ROI on a degree is falling fast.

Kirsten Winkler of the blog big think shares one [alternative to college degrees as credentials](https://bigthink.com/ideas/38203). 

**I see only two possible solutions: we continue to bail out colleges by feeding borrowed money to the bubble, or we unwind our addiction to traditional higher education.**

Exit question: Do we do as Obama says and borrow more money to endow colleges, or do we begin dismantling the “college or death” mantra? Or is there a third way out?
