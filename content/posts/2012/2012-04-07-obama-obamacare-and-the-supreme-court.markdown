First, my prediction:

 

1) Is Obamacare a tax? (8-1 Against)

 

Technically speaking, if Obamacare is a tax, it could be non-justiciable until implementation. However, judicial precedence suggests the courts may review a tax before its implementation in certain circumstances. The Government did not even want to argue that Obamacare was a tax, so the Supreme Court (SCOTUS) appointed a separate attorney to make the argument. The only SCOTUS justice that appeared to entertain this line was Justice Breyer.

 

2) Is the mandate unconstitutional? (5-4 For)

 

3) Is the mandate severable? (7-2 Against)

 

CITIZENS UNITED

 

It is not judicial restraint to accept an unsound, narrow argument just so the Court can avoid another argument with broader implications. Indeed, a court would be remiss in performing its duties were it to accept an unsound principle merely to avoid the necessity of making a broader ruling.

 

We find no basis for the proposition that, in the context of political speech, the Government may impose restrictions on certain disfavored speakers. **Both history and logic lead us to this conclusion.**
