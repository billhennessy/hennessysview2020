We're past Empty Chair Day. The conventions are over.  Barack Obama still stands between us and liberty. And the Establishment's more worried about its $$$ future than about America's future.

What does that mean?  It means _you and I _ will determine what happens in Election 2012 and beyond.

If you want to have a hand in America's future, listen up.  You have a chance to join the American Restoration.

St. Louis Tea Party Coalition will open a GOTV Activist Office in the next week or so. But there's something you can do _this week.  _

Be at The Pillar in Chesterfield, MO, on Tuesday, September 11, at 7:00 PM for:
