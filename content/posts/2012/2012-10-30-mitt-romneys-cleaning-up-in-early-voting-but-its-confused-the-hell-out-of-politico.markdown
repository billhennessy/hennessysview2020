Gallup released its [early voting poll today](https://www.gallup.com/poll/158420/registered-voters-already-cast-ballots.aspx), and it shows Mitt Romney winning 52% to 45%—right in line with their Likely Voter poll numbers. Here’s the chart.

### Politico Reporter Can’t Read

But Gallup’s section on early voting by party ID completely lost Politico’s Kevin Robillard.

Robillard looked at the chart that shows when voters intend to vote by party and candidate and mistook it for voting results. This poll question shows that those who support Obama as as likely to vote early as are those who support Romney. No surprise.

Here’s precisely what Gallup says about this section:

> However, when one looks at the voting intentions of likely voters according to candidate support, the political impact for the two candidates appears to be roughly equal.
>

And here’s what Robillard thinks it says:

> Neither candidate has a particular edge among early voters nationally compared to those who will cast their ballots on election day

[Robillard doesn’t understand](https://www.politico.com/news/stories/1012/83039.html?hp=l9_b1) that there are simply MORE people who intend to vote for Romney than for Obama.

What’s worse is the entire liberal media establishment is now confused—or lying—about the poll. They’re taking Robillard’s stupidity and running with it.

### More Bad News For Obama

[John Nolte points out that Obama’s early voting results are down 22 points from 2008](https://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2012/10/30/Gallup-Shows-22-point-drop-in-obama-early-voting-advantage). That’s huge, and explains why Minnesota and Pennsylvania have moved from Safe for Obama to Toss-Up.

If Romney wins Pennsylvania, we’ll be celebrating early on the November 6. Call your friends in PA, comment on Pennsylvania blogs and news sites. Target people who will vote right if they vote. Forget conversions—just move the friendlies.
