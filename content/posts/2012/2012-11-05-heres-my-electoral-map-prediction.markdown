Yes, I’m feeling a wave toward Romney.

My gut tells me this year is a lot like 1980.

**1980 Was A Dead Heat**

The [final Gallup poll that year had a dead heat](https://www.gallup.com/poll/110548/gallup-presidential-election-trialheat-trends-19362004.aspx#2). [Time Magazine’s November 3, 1980](https://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,924487,00.html), called the race a dead heat. So did Newsweek.

The press was hoping John B. Anderson, a former Republican Congressman running for president as an independent, would siphon votes from Reagan. He did siphon votes from Reagan, but not nearly enough. America was fed up with Jimmy Carter.

What appears to be a dead heat to pollsters could, in fact, be a landslide for Romney. And I think that’s the only way Romney wins.

**Romney Must Win Big To Win**

In a close race, Democrats will cheat, steal, and defraud. They will fight it in the courts, discover ballots in trunks, and sue to let people vote until they get the numbers they need.

For Romney to win, the race must appear hopeless to Democrats before midnight Tuesday.

That’s exactly what I think will happen.

What do you think?
