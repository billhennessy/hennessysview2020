I met Raz Shaver in 2010. Even though he’s many years my junior, Raz has been an insightful, patient, and indispensible to mentor in grassroots activism.

Raz continues to help me and St. Louis Tea Party Coalition from his bunker in Texas. He also helps groups like St. Louis Tea Party all around the country. Victories and 2010, those to come in 2012, owe, in a large degree, to Raz Shafer.

 

Selfless Availability

 

Raz jumped at the chance to return to the St. Louis area to speak at the October After Party on Thursday, October 18, at 7:00 pm at Pio’s in St. Charles.

 

Why would he travel to an After Party?

 

Because Missouri holds the key to the US Senate, and Senate is key to reversing Obamacare and defending the Supreme Court.

 

Come Out And Meet Raz Thursday

 

Don’t miss your chance to meet a rising star in political activism. [Raz will be at Pio’s, 403 First Capitol Drive, St. Charles, MO.](https://www.meetup.com/The-After-Party-St-Louis-Tea-Party/events/81499972/)

Thanks, Raz. And thank you, in advance, for joining The After Party.
