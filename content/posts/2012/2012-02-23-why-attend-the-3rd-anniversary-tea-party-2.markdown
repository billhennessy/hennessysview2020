Yes, I’ve written about little else. The [3rd Anniversary Tea Party](https://3rdanniversaryteaparty.eventbrite.com/) is something of an obsession with me. And for good reasons:   * Obama is [surging](https://wp.me/p653B-31X)   * [Apathy](https://wp.me/p653B-31V) has seized the right   * [America’s future](https://www.commentarymagazine.com/2012/01/10/poll-americans-obama-reelection-iran-nuclear-weapons/) hangs in the balance

But there’s a much bigger reason you—you, the person reading this blog—should attend the 3rd Anniversary Tea Party.

That reason is personal, powerful, and acute.

That reason is this:**You cannot live with yourself if Obama wins and you failed to do everything in your power to stop him.**

With your attendance at the 3rd Anniversary Tea Party assure Obama’s defeat? No.

Will your failure to attend guarantee his re-election? No.

But by actively participating in the 3rd Anniversary Tea Party, then following through on the things you learned, you can make a big difference. You might make THE difference.

**Or your apathy might make a difference of another kind.**

And I know you can’t live with that. 

I don’t want anyone waking up the day after the election and saying, “I should have done more.” 

That’s why I’m asking you to attend the 3rd Anniversary Tea Party.
