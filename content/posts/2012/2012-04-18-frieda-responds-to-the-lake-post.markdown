I blogged about[ the battle of the Tea Party's future going on around the Lake of the Ozarks](https://hennessysview.com/2012/04/15/down-at-the-lake-they-want-to-know-is-the-tea-party-dead/) recently.

I received this response from Freida Keough, St. Louis County Director of[ Missouri Precinct Project](https://www.moprecinctproject.org/):


> My answer: We have 56 positions for committeemen and women in 28 Townships for St.Louis County. Did you know that 35 new individuals filed for these positions in addition to the incumbents. Coincidence? I don't think this happened because people felt they have nothing else to do. I think people are doing this because they have been energized by the tea party movement and are realizing that if you want to change things you need to get in the game from the ground up. And this did not just happening in St.Louis. It is happening across the state. This is very encouraging and I believe pretty soon we will see changes in the Missouri Republican Party. At the last Central Committee meeting in Clayton, four new committee people were appointed.

Ever heard of Raging Elephants? _Stampede_
