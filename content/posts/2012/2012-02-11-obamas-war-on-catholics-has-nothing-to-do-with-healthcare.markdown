Obama’s dictate that Catholic organizations must participate in contraception and abortion has nothing to do with healthcare or rights or contraception or anything of the sort. Not at all. Modern dictatorships don’t operate that way.

**Obama just destroyed the free practice clause of the First Amendment, and that’s exactly what he intended. **

> Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof

Obama declared _jihad_ on Christianity.

](https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/crusaders.jpg)Obama exercised absolute power—the power he warned us about at the State of the Union address.

Notice his “compromise” on the matter. Today, Obama ordered insurance companies to provide contraceptives and abortifacients to employees of the Catholic church . . . _for free!_

**Obama has told us that he despises the Constitution because it “reflected fundamental flaw of this country that continues to this day.”**

Subordinating the Catholic church to his despotic rule is just one step in his perverted mission to fix those flaws.

**Time to open up a can of crusade on this potentate.**
