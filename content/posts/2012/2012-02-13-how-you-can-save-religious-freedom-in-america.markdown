When Barack Obama declared that Catholics must either violate their consciences or face government persecution, he wasn’t going after just Catholics. [Nor was he promoting healthcare](https://hennessysview.com/political-science/obamas-war-on-catholics-has-nothing-to-do-with-healthcare/). 

**Barack Obama and his myrmidon Kathleen Sebelius tried to erase the First Amendment**. They tried to erase religious freedom. They tried to take away yet another foundational liberty that made America America.

**And they will try again![![](https://www.jewishjournal.com/images/bloggers_auto/religious_freedom2.jpg)

Unless you stop them. 

But how are you going to stop them alone?

**Well, you are not alone.**

On [February 24 and 25](https://3rdanniversaryteaparty.eventbrite.com/), you can meet your army and get your training. You can become a soldier in the war for religious and economic freedom.

The [3rd Anniversary Tea Party](https://3rdanniversaryteaparty.eventbrite.com/) weekend is boot camp for the battle of 2012. For just $65 for the entire weekend—meals included—you can arm yourself with the latest in political warfare. 

Can’t make it both days? Tickets are available for Friday evening or Saturday, too. 

But please [sign up now](https://3rdanniversaryteaparty.eventbrite.com/). We need to know how many soldiers are willing to launch this battle. 

If you cannot attend, sponsor someone else to take your place. 

**Please pray for our mission whether you attend or not. We need God’s help above all else.**

Obama showed us just how far he’s willing to go to [eradicate, or at least subdue, religion from the United States](https://www.ocregister.com/opinion/church-339789-one-catholic.html). He’s willing to go further. Given another four years and the mandate of re-election, Obama’s change will extinguish hope.

**This is our crusade. This is our battle. This our prayer. That we may remain [free to worship and live](https://www.jewishjournal.com/bloggish/item/washingtons_letter_on_religious_freedom_not_so_free_20111122/), to work and pray as we think best in pursuit of happiness and a good society**.
