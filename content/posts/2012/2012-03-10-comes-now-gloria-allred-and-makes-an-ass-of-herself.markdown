The feminist attorney famous for making herself famous just couldn't let the Sandra Fluke case go.

Gloria Allred sent a letter to a Florida District Attorney asking him to arrest Rush Limbaugh for violation of an ancient Florida law.


> The statute stipulates that anyone who “speaks of and concerning any woman, married or unmarried, falsely and maliciously imputing to her a want of chastity” is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree. Allred explained that the statute recently came to her attention as having never been repealed, and that it could very well apply to Limbaugh’s remarks as his show is broadcast from West Palm Beach.

**Just one problem, Gloria: it looks to me that the truth would be a perfect defense for Rush.  **

The statute requires that the perp falsely impute a woman's "want of chastity." (That's "slutiness" for [those of you in Rio Linda.](https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2007/11/30/rio_linda_explained_for_those_in_rio_linda))  But Ms. Fluke has pretty much handed Rush his defense with her public comments.  **Unmarried women in possession of their chastity don't need $3,000 worth of contraceptives.**

Another thing: Did Ms. Allred ask Sandra Fluke if she wanted her help?  The answer is "no."


> [Allred] said Friday that she has not yet been in touch with Fluke.

“I don’t reach out to women, they reach out to me,” she said. “If she did reach out to me, obviously I would respond.”

**Maybe Ms. Fluke doesn't want her sex life to become an artifact of discovery in a criminal trial in Florida.**  If the DA prosecutes Rush, and his best defense is the truth, then Sandra [Fluke's chastity will be on trial as much as Rush's speech](https://hennessysview.com/news/how-rush-limbaugh-revived-chivalry/).
