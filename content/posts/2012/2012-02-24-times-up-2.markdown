The [3rd Anniversary Tea Party](https://3rdanniversaryteaparty.eventbrite.com/) begins tonight at 6:30 at the Crowne Plaza in Clayton.

You can make a difference. But not alone. If you join forces with just three other people, you’ll triple your influence. 

Show up. Bring two friends. Leave with a company a soldiers for the America’s liberation.
