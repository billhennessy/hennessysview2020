I'm proud to know David Rose.  Dr. Rose is chairman of UMSL's economics department. He's also the President of [the Discussion Club](https://www.discussionclub.org/), one of St. Louis's most valuable intellectual assets.

In [this interview with Russ Roberts](https://www.econtalk.org/archives/2012/01/david_rose_on_t.html), Dr. Rose discusses his new book _[Moral Foundations of Economic Behavior](https://www.amazon.com/Moral-Foundation-Economic-Behavior/dp/0199781745/)_.

This is great stuff for everyone, especially economic liberty fiends like me.
