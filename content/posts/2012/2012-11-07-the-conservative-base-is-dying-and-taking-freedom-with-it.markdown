Consider these numbers:



	  * **9.8 million**
	  * <del>**11.6 million **</del>**16.8 million**
	  * **55%**
	  * **61%**

Between the 2008 and 2012 elections:

	  * 9.8 million people died*, 55% of them were reliable Republican voters
	  * [16.8 <del>11.6</del> million people reached voting age](https://www.civicyouth.org/you-ask-we-answer-16-8-million-new-youth-eligible-to-vote-in-2012/?%3E)--61% of them are semi-reliable Democrat voters

Between those years, neither the GOP nor conservative leaning organizations did anything significant to deal with this **demographic cliff. **We know the cost.

**What was Obama's popular vote margin?**  About the same as the difference between deaths and new voters. (1.8 million difference in dead voters vs. new voting age, and 1.07 difference in vote.)

For the next four years,** there is only one objective: inform the kids.**

On this front, there's a glimmer of hope. According to [a Harvard Institute of Politics survey](https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-fiscally-conservative-2012-10#ixzz2BVBgIsRi), the youngest of those 11.6 million new voters, are **becoming fiscal conservatives**:


> In one poll, for instance, he found that 42 percent of 18- and 19-year-olds identified as "conservative," compared with just over one-third who said they were "liberal." By comparison, those proportions were nearly flipped for 22- to 24-year-olds: 39 percent said they were "liberal," and a third called themselves "conservative." It was much the same for older twentysomethings.


Obama's disastrous economy has a lot to do with this "schism" between younger and older Millennials. Though 51% of voters blame the nation's economy on George W. Bush, the 18- and 19-year-olds were 14 or 15 when the economy crashed.  They were less aware of the good times of the 00's and more aware of Obama's inability to fix things.

**Crush Sensibilities**

Knowing these facts--the death of aging conservatives, which will continue, and the matriculation of school-trained Democrat voters--I see no reason to consider the past. **It's time to focus exclusively on the future.**

The future I see involves a three-pronged strategy to reform conservative politics:



	  * Marketing
	  * Psychology
	  * Messaging

This is a moral duty. I won't waste more of my time placating the sensibilities of the establishment. That's both the GOP establishment and the Tea Party establishment. (Yes, there's a Tea Party establishment, and it stopped helping the situation in 2010.)

**I need your help. **

If you want to help advance liberty and slow tyranny, statism, authoritarianism, whatever, then[ follow this link and tell me](https://stlouisteaparty.com/contact/). Tell me you want to help.

**UPDATE**

I'm not the only one talking about the Republican problem of targeting seniors instead of talking to kids. [Allahpundit](https://hotair.com/archives/2012/11/07/looking-at-the-national-exit-poll/):


>  The advantage of relying heavily on senior citizens, as the GOP does, is that they turn out reliably on election day. The disadvantage is, er, that they die, just as 18-year-olds — most of whom are pro-Obama — are coming onto the rolls.


The GOP needs a Cadillac-like makeover, and it needs one now.
