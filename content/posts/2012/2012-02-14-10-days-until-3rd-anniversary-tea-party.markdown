**We will also have favorite St. Louis speaker Bill Federer for our lunch keynote!** Bill will entrance you with his knowledge of history and religion. He is one of the most in demand speakers in St. Louis and across the nation.  
Our training offering includes several activist tracts-from the beginning to the advanced-you will not be disappointed. We will not only give you the training but we are going to put you to work that day.

_If you want to learn to use Twitter, you will begin using it immediately and you will develop an effective action plan for using it through November to drive opinion._  
_If you have always wanted to blog-you will start a blog, learn basic design and find out how build your following._  
_If you want to become a Precinct Captain and learn how to effectively knock on doors and influence voters-you will learn everything you need to know **now**_.  
**Plus** a full **Mock Caucus** from beginning to end so you are prepared to influence the Caucus process in March.  
These are just a few examples of the things we will teach you in one very intense day of activist training.  
**Breakfast and lunch are included.**  
It's been 3 years since we all met for the first time on the steps of the Arch. We've become a major force in politics, and perhaps the most powerful faction in the Republican party. This weekend is all about winning! Friday night is fascinating evening with one of America's foremost historians, Dr. Larry Schweikart. Saturday you get a full day of serious activist training plus breakfast and lunch, amazing speakers and trainers. This final push toward the election is what our movement is all about. Join us.
