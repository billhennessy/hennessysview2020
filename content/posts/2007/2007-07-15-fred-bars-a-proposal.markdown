Remember "Rush Rooms?"

These were restaurants in cities around the country where people gathered to eat lunch and listen to Rush Limbaugh.

To promote the social side of politics, I'd like to see a nationwide chain of "Fred Bars" where Thompson supporters get together for an adult beverage, laughs, and encouragement.  No Kumbaya singing, though I know this proposal reeks of former Jesuit peacenik filth.

I make this call to St. Louis area restaurant and bar owners, and hope bloggers in other cities will do the same.  Five to ten establishments in all the major cities, plus one or two in all the small towns, will give a Fredite a place to go any night of the week.  We'll wear our Fred apparel, drink from Fred glasses, and watch "The Hunt for Fred October" on DVD.

We bloggers can provide free links or other ads for our local Fred bars on our web sites, giving the whole damn thing a capitalist slant.

Thoughts?  Offers?
