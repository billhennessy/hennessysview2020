We nominated Bob Dole, didn't we?

Anyway, [TexasFred](https://texasfred.net/archives/401)'s has been listening in on the Romney campaign and heard this:


> Mitt Romney has cited the social welfare network of the Lebanese Hezbollah terror group as a role model the U.S. should copy to help promote “goodness” and “freedom” around the world.


I know . . . out of context, read the whole thing, and all that.  Still, a guy running for president ought to know that praising Hezbollah is a good way to become a really, really difficult trivia question about people who ran for president in 2008.
