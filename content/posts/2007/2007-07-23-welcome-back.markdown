You might have received an ugly error if you tried to view Hennessy's View in the past week. 

I switched hosting providers (I'm on GoDaddy), and I transfered the domain over to the new hoster.  Unfortunately, Yahoo!, the losing registrar, locked the DNS, leaving the site without a host file for a week.

But now we're back.  Thanks for the patience.
