Senator Clinton asked the Pentagon to describe its plans to withdraw from Iraq. The Pentagon—specifically, undersecretary of defense, Eric Edelman—replied in the most appropriate manner imaginable:


> Premature and public discussion of the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq reinforces enemy propaganda that the United States will abandon its allies in Iraq, much as we are perceived to have done in Vietnam, Lebanon and Somalia


In response, Ms. Clinton displayed the kind of hysterium one associates with under-medicated paranoid schizophrenics. Clinton ranted and screamed. Perhaps Ms. Clinton's marriage has made her hypersensitive to the issue of premature withdrawal.

Edelman was, of course, right. Democrats are providing the enemy all the ammunition they can load in the psychological warfare department. Ms. Clinton, who claimed in 2003 that evidence known to her during her husband's presidency justified war with Iraq, has joined the rest of the Democrat party in its subversion of the US Army. Democrats want America to lose, because Democrats seek the destruction of the United States.

What Ms. Clinton's hissy fit has accomplished is two-fold: she's set back the American war effort while setting back the cause of a woman President. While any "male" Democrat might have shown hysterium like Hillary's, people would have passed it off as a Democratic tantrum. When a woman does it, people think, "what do you expect?"
