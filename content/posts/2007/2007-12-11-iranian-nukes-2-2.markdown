Has everyone missed the real story behind the [National Intelligence Assessment](https://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/12/06/iran.nie/index.html?section=cnn_latest) of Iranian nukes?




Conservatives, like [Rush Limbaugh](https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/daily/site_120607/content/01125107.guest.html) and [Michelle Malkin](https://michellemalkin.com/2007/12/04/president-bush-faces-the-press-and-congress/), are doing back-bends to convince us that Iran is still a nuclear threat.  Fine.  I won't argue that point.  But a much larger story here looms, and everyone is missing it.




Iran's reported abandonment of it nuclear weapons drive coincides with the United States' invasion of Iraq!




Make it a headline.




Libya capitulated when Bush nutted up and invaded Iraq.  So did Iran. The Intelligence Assessment validates the Bush Doctrine.
