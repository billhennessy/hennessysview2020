[Sean Hackbarth](https://www.theamericanmind.com/2007/08/07/im-with-fred/), the guy who runs [The American Mind](https://www.theamericanmind.com) blog, has jumped onboard the Fred Thompson victory train as a member of the web team.

Congratulations to Sean and to Fred.  Both will benefit greatly from the effort, I am sure.
