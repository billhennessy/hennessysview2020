Perhaps it would be best if [Mr. Arkin](https://blog.washingtonpost.com/earlywarning/2007/01/the_troops_also_need_to_suppor.html), wearing a dingy t-shirt and stained khakis, locked himself into a small room lighted by a lone, unsheathed incandescent bulb strung from a wire, supplied with a bottle of store label whiskey and a loaded Browning 9mm semi-automatic pistol, drank the whiskey, cried apologies to his absent mother, and discharged a single, lethal round into his angry and imbalanced head, ending a life whose pinnacle was to anger men and women smarter, braver, and stronger than he.

H/T [Michelle Malkin](https://michellemalkin.com/archives/006804.htm) who pulled out this quote from Arkin's attack on the military:


> we pay the soldiers a decent wage, take care of their families, provide them with housing and medical care and vast social support systems and ship obscene amenities into the war zone for them, we support them in every possible way, and their attitude is that we should in addition roll over and play dead, defer to the military and the generals and let them fight their war, and give up our rights and responsibilities to speak up because they are above society?


Any doubts that liberalism=terrorism?Â

I'm sure this is against the law, and I'm sure Mr. Arkin is the kind of candy-ass shitbag who would press charges, so I won't say that I would be happy to off this motherfucker with a rusty sardine can a jar of hydrochloric acid.Â  But I will say this:Â  if some Iraq or Afghanistan vet decides to use Arkin's shameful carcass for target practice, I will do anything to get on the jury.Â

Â May Mr. Arkin rest in peace.Â  And soon.
