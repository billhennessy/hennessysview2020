I was lying in the bathtub after a rare Sunday afternoon football practice when the Big Red post-game show was interrupted:


> We interrupt this program for a CBS Radio News special report.  

I'm Morton Dean.  The US State Department has announced that a group of students under control of the Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran have siezed the American Embassy in Tehran, taking more than 100 Americans hostage.


or something like that.

It was [November 4, 1979.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_hostage_crisis)  The action, as much as anything else, gave us Ronald Reagan for 8 years. 

But those of who lived through [Jimmy Carter's inept management ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Eagle_Claw)of the crisis have longed for the end to the Islamic regime in Iran.  We've studied the vast chasm of philosophy between the Iran's ruling despots and the Iranian people.  We know that Iran could America's greatest ally in the Southwest Asia. 

When we hear that[ Iran is lobbing shells into Kurdish Iraq](https://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,,2152325,00.html), we want our government to declare war on Iran to liberate her people.

My God, I miss Reagan.
