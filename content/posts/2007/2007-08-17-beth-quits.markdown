According to a disturbing post on [MY Vast Right Wing Conspiracy](https://bamapachyderm.com/archives/2007/08/14/6555/), Beth is hanging up the . . . the . . . whatever it is bloggers use to ply their trade.

I'll take her at her word, but I'm not happy.  For -- how many years? -- Beth's crisp, snappy, sarcastic, sometimes cynical, always lucid, and 100 percent on-the-money writing has made the little dramas of the news bearable.  When I've been discouraged, Beth has picked me up.

I wish her all the best, and her thoughts are always welcome in my view.
