[The Sun Online ](https://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2007350097,00.html)carries the story of new British Prime Minister Gordon Brown's rather effusive praise of George W. Bush's leadership.

In his speech, Brown referred to Winston Churchill:


> 

> 
> The Prime Minister vowed to take Winston Churchill’s lead and make Britain’s ties with America even stronger.
> 
> 

> 
> Mr Brown stunned critics by **THANKING** President Bush for the fight against Islamic extremism, and insisted the UK-US relationship will be his No1 foreign policy priority.
> 
> 

> 
> He said on his first visit to the President’s US retreat at Camp David: “Winston Churchill spoke of the ‘joint inheritance’ of our two countries.”
> 
> 







Many expected Brown to chill US-UK relations on the heels of Tony Blair's tight relationship with the White House.  If chill is to come, it will come another day, I suppose.
