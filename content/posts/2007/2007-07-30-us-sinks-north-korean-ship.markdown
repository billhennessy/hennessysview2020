[The Gateway Pundit ](https://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2007/07/us-sinks-north-korean-ship-bound-for.html)(which you should read every day) discusses a Debka File report claiming the US sank a North Korean ship bound for Iran carrying nuclear weapon making cargo.

Debka is _notorious_ for reporting stories that are, well, stories that aren't true.  But such a heavy-handed action by the US could explain North Korea's recent cooperation on the nuclear front. 

We'll keep our eye's peeled.
