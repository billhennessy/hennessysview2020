From 2004 through about September 12, the American and European left bet the farm on terrorists.

Here's Dick Durbin, the anti-American from Illinois, in September:


> In a speech Friday at the Center for National Policy, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said, "President Bush is preparing to tell the nation, once again, that his strategy in Iraq is succeeding. We know what the Bush-Petraeus report will say: The surge is working. Be patient. The reality is despite heroic efforts by U.S. troops, the Bush surge is not working. . . "By carefully manipulating the statistics, the Bush-Petraeus report will try to persuade us that violence in Iraq is decreasing and thus the surge is working." ([source)](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=3575785&page=1)


Senate Majority Leader (and heed that title) Harry Reid declared defeat in April:


> this war is lost and the surge is not accomplishing anything as indicated by the extreme violence in Iraq yesterday," said Reid. ([source](https://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/04/20/politics/main2709229.shtml?source=RSSattr=HOME_2709229))


But don't stop there.  Google your way through the left's treatment of war in July, August, and September.  Note the glee with which the writers reported every American soldier's death and dismemberment.  See the joy in Nancy Pelosi's eyes when she discusses roadside bombs.  August 2007 marks the Democrat Party's irrevocable pact with the devil.   

Things have changed. 

Now that the US and her allies have defeated the terrorists in Iraq, the left is mum.  Democrats, for example, will not permit talk of the war in Iraq mention in the House or Senate.  The leftist media no longer mentions Bush's war, for Bush's war, always a just cause, is now a victorious  campaign.

The Times of London (h/t [Captain's Quarters](https://www.captainsquartersblog.com/mt/archives/015816.php)), not exactly a right-wing blog, noticed the absence of news from Iraq.  But if you dig deeply into America's most anti-American media, you'll find that even the New York Times cannot hide all of the truth all of the time.  From the Lede:


> Back in [September](https://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/11/watching-the-iraq-hearings-day-2/), General David Petraeus reported a slide in violence that had some impressed and others saying that it might be a fluke. About two months later, many more are acknowledging progress, and [Osama bin Laden](https://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/22/bin-laden-tape-drop-in-iraq-violence/) sounds like one of them.

Adding to the optimism are news stories anticipating [the lowest American death toll since early 2006](https://www.csmonitor.com/2007/1031/p01s01-usmi.html). If the toll remains at 23 - and that won't be a sure thing until several days after the month is over and the military finishes its October announcements - that would be a drop of 97 U.S. deaths from the month of May.

Even an alarming Pentagon estimate on a quadrupling of sniper attacks [turned out to be very wrong](https://blog.wired.com/defense/2007/10/pentagon-sniper.html). Indeed, sniper attacks have dropped. ([source](https://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/31/seizing-the-slide-in-iraq-violence/?hp))


And remember the GAO's propaganda attack on General Petraeus released just before his Congressional testimony?  Well, the NYT buries an update that discuss the remarkable progress in the war.


> Exactly two months after its [pessimistic report to Congress](https://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/08/30/a-more-pessimistic-report-on-iraq/), the Government Accountability Office began a new report on a positive note. "Since G.A.O. last reported in September 2007," the report said, "the number of enemy attacks in Iraq has declined."


As this blog has maintained for a month, the war is over and the liberals lost.  If only, now, America had an unbiased media who would report the truth.
