Just a few days, other bloggers ([Captain Ed](https://www.captainsquartersblog.com/mt/archives/012095.php)) and [I speculated ](https://hennessysview.com/?p=8162)on the ramifications on Democrat surrender strategies of the increasingly obvious improvements in Iraq since the surge began.  Ever the [WaPo ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/21/AR2007082102025_pf.html)worried about how the Dems would deal.

Now we know: propaganda.

Following the phony story that [Gen. Pace ](https://hennessysview.com/?p=8167)would urge the President to cut troops in Iraq by half, the Red Crescent, today, released a report that a record number of Iraqis have fled their homes in fear of their lives since the surge began.


> "Does this surge have anything to do with it? We don't know," said Saeed Haqi, head of the Iraqi Red Crescent - the local partner organization of the International Committee of the Red Cross. "But they're leaving because of the security situation in general." ([source](https://apnews.myway.com/article/20070826/D8R8LDBG0.html))


Yesterday, the AP ran a story based solely on its own "compilations" headlined: "[Iraq Body Count Running at Double Pace](https://apnews.myway.com/article/20070826/D8R8HPD80.html)."  The yellow story cites no authority other than the AP itself.  But the AP's lack of credible sources doesn't prevent it from demanding a higher standard from anyone who challenges its assertions:


> Brig. Gen. Richard Sherlock, deputy director for operational planning for the Pentagon's Joint Chiefs of Staff, said violence in Iraq "has continued to decline and is at the lowest level since June 2006."

He offered no statistics to back his claim.


What brazenness.  The big media, the "drive-bys" as Rush Limbaugh calls them, are [different agencies of the same body](https://copiousdissent.blogspot.com/2007/08/msm-democrat-party-revel-in-american.html), like Sinn Féin is to the IRA.  CNN reporters take LOAs to run Democrat campaign.   Recently, [MSNBC ](https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19113485/)checked out 143 reporters, discovering that 125 had donated cash to Democrats or liberal political organizations.  Only 16 reporters gave to Republicans.  Clearly, the DNC has provided the MSM careful instructions on reporting on Iraq. Bastards.
