This is the [blogosphere's answer to O. J. Simpson's low speed chase](https://www.captainsquartersblog.com/mt/archives/011065.php).

If I were a client of Mr. Reynolds's law firm, I'd check my bill very closely for charges this date.  Seems he's done nothing but DNS management all day.  By 10:00 p.m., Reynolds will reach the end of the internet and www.imwithfred2008.com will point at Hennessy's View.

I hope.
