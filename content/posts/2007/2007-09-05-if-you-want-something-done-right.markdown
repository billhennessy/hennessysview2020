. . . you have to do it yourself.

That's the MSM's motto over the upcoming Patraeus report to Congress on progress in Iraq.

The _facts_ are obvious:  since the surge and offensive began, the terrorists in Iraq have become less effective.  The surge and the offensive are working.  Those who agree with this view inlude these liberals and Democrats:

I can't the MSM disagree, but I can say they don't care.  They want America to lose the war, and they won't sit idly by while George Bush and the military go out and win this thing.

The MSM counted on the insurgents to stage massive attacks prior to the Patraeus report to Congress.  So far, that hasn't happened.  The MSN, particular through their Associated Press, have filled our heads with every negative story on Iraq they can find--even if they have to make them up. 

If mainstream reporters had any guts, they'd strapped bombs to themselves and detonated them up in malls. They'd join the terrorists outright in the war against Western Civilization. 

But these AP cowards are just that:  cowards.  They run gratuitous, negative statistics about Iraq and ONLY negative statistitics.  They intentionally bury good news out of Iraq.   They invent negative statistics when no one else will provide them.  When nothing else works, they conduct a[ slanted poll ](https://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/08/16/poll.iraq.report/index.html?iref=newssearch)attempting to prove that most American believe Patraeus's report is a lie.   

How do we start a new service for people who don't hate America?
