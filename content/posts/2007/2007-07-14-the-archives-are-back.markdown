At least most of them, beginning with August 2000.

The load process replaced a lot of single and double quotes with some annoying ASCII character, but I'm not in the mood to clean it up right now, if you want to know the truth.  In the first place, that stuff bores me.  In the second place, my wife would have about two hemorrhages if spent any more time on the computer today.

So relax and enjoy the post.
