Tell everyone Hennessy broke the story.  America won the Iraq war.  The insurgency is broken!  Peace prevails.  The terrorists are routed!Where are the headlines?  A man between the ages of 18 and 30 has a better chance of being murdered in Philadelphiathan of dying in Iraq in September.  The third head of al Qaeda in Iraq is dead--three in 18 months.  Ascending to that throne is no promotion. Face it, folks, we won the war.  We won the peace.  Face this, too:  the average American is too stupid to know the difference, so she votes Democrat and makes Bush jokes.
