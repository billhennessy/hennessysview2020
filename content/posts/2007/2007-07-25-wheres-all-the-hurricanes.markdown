Al Gore said this would be the worst year for hurricanes since hurricaning began, in 1952.

[Matt Margolis](https://www.gopbloggers.org/mt/archives/005005.php), who does great research, has the answer.


> The 2007 hurricane season may be less severe than forecast due to cooler-than-expected water temperatures in the tropical Atlantic, private forecaster WSI Corp said on Tuesday.


Just not enough global warming.  The Gores'll have to kick out a lot more CO2 in 2008.  See Matt's piece for the whole story.
