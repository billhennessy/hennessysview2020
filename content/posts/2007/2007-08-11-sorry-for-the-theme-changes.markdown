I know this site has changed a lot, but there's a reason.

I was sick of the traditional blog format, so I switched to magazine layout.  Unfortunately, the theme I used has incompatible with some plug-ins and javascript links I really need.  So I customized the [HemingwayEx ](https://nalinmakar.com/hemingwayex)theme.

I love this theme (sorry if you don't) and plan to keep it for a while.

**Please scroll down to take my poll on the new theme.**
