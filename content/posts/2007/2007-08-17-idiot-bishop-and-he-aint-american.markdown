Catholic Bishop Tiny Muskens (make your own joke) says all Christians should [refer to God only as "Allah](https://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=52928)."  The Dutch bishop believes that surrendering to the Muslims is in the best interest of Christianity.

Thanks, but no thanks, Your Excellency.  Instead of that, how about if we call you "de-frocked" Bishop?

According to CWN:


> The Dutch bishop admitted that his suggestion was not likely to gain widespread acceptance. But he predicted that within a century or two, Dutch Catholics would be addressing prayers to "Allah."


Yeah, no shit, Sherlock.  That's because most of Europe is overrun with raghead terrorists.  Seventy years ago, he'd have boldly predicted that "in a year or two, Dutch Catholics will be calling the head of state 'Der Furor.'"

A lot of Catholics I know say that the Pope's motu proprio on the Latin Mass will drive people away from the church.  Good.  I hope it drives away Bishop Muskens and his ilk.  The church is peopled with too many idiots as it is, particularly in its rectories.

_Update_:Â  I thought I was the only person who saw this story, but [Professor Bainbridge](https://www.professorbainbridge.com/2007/08/the-name-of-god.html) has an eloquent argument _against_ calling God 'Allah.'
