Mark Steyn might have said it best


Benazir Bhutto's return to Pakistan had a mad recklessness about it which give today's events a horrible[![](https://ak.imgfarm.com/images/ap/thumbnails//APTOPIX_Pakistan_Bhutto_Blast.sff_RWP103_20071227091520.jpg)

Were any of us surprised to hear the news today? An Islamofascist slug shot to death Benazir Bhutto then blew up, either of his own volition or remotely by his sponsors.  (We've learned to not believe that all terrorism executors are volunteers.)

Pakistan is home to Usama bin Laden, al Qaeda's central command, and the what remains of the Taliban.  It is the staging ground for countless murderous forays into Afghanistan, claiming scores of American and Afghani lives.  It is the epicenter of the war on terror.

What happens next in Pakistan is critical to our success in defeating Islamofascism.  Musharraf must call upon the United States to jointly occupy his country's western regions, ferreting out and killing without mercy or hesitation anyone who resembles a terrorist.  I mean that, so there's no need for the lefties to write and tell me all all of the negative connotations of my policy:  find them, kill them, bury them in pig skin.  Even the NYT wants American involvement:


> American policy must now be directed at building a strong democracy in Pakistan that has the respect and the support of its own citizens and the will and the means to fight Al Qaeda and the Taliban.

More likely, emboldened by Bhutto's murder, the terrorists will next attack Musharraf.  In a country where 48 percent of the populace supports al Qaeda, Musharraf is seen as Western as Reagan.  Unless he acts ruthlessly and immediately, his time and his life will soon pass.

What then?  Then 60 nuclear missiles will belong to Usama bin Laden.  Let your imagination fill in the blanks.

One way or another, America voting Democrat in 2008 will be seen as terrorism's invitation to revisit mass murder on American soil.
