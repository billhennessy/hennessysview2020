I will be uploading my archives--going back to 1999--over the weekend.  If you think this is a new blog, you're mistaken.  It's been around since before the term "web log" was coined.  But I moved my hosting earlier in the year, and loading posts dating back to the Clinton administration ain't no easy task for a man my age.

Thanks for reading, and Dominus vobiscum
