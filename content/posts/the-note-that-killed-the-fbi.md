Agents of the FBI plotted to frame and destroy General James Flynn for politic purposes according to handwritten notes released today. 

General Flynn, a 30-year Army veteran and 3-star General, pled guilty to false charges in order to protect his family from further harassment by the FBI in 2017. 

Now, the law firm that once represented Flynn has release thousands of documents it previously illegally refused to turn over. One of those documents is a handwritten note.

The damning paragraph:

> “What is our goal? Truth/Admission or to get him to lie, so we can prosecute [Flynn] or get him fired?”

We know which path they pursued. The FBI violated every trust by forcing a 3-star General to confess to a crime he didn't commit, which FBI documents released earlier proved he didn't commit. (The interviewing agents stated that Flynn did not lie.)

The FBI is a corrupt organization that has made to visible attempt to clean itself up. It is a dangerous state-police agency that can destroy lives without consequence. FBI agents, to this point, have been completely above the law. 

Instead of trying to reform this corrupt and dangerous agency, it's time to destroy it. 

I call on Congress and the president to work on legislation dismantling the FBI and prohibiting all current and recent employees of the FBI from employment with the federal government or any company with federal contracts.
