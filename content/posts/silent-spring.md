Prolonged social isolation is more damaging to health than smoking, heavy drinking, or obesity.

In other words, the lockdown is shortening lives. From the American Psychological Association (APA):

> According to a meta-analysis co-authored by Julianne Holt-Lunstad, PhD, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Brigham Young University, lack of social connection heightens health risks as much as smoking 15 cigarettes a day or having alcohol use disorder. She’s also found that loneliness and social isolation are twice as harmful to physical and mental health as obesity (Perspectives on Psychological Science, Vol. 10, No. 2, 2015).

> "There is robust evidence that social isolation and loneliness significantly increase risk for premature mortality, and the magnitude of the risk exceeds that of many leading health indicators," Holt­Lunstad says.

Because of terrible data science (or fraudulent data science), states and cities have forced almost every American into a period of prolonged social isolation. 

When officials adopted this extremely unhealthy policy, here's what the "experts" were saying:

1. Almost 4 of every 100 who contracted the disease would die.
2. Between 1 million and 2.2 million Americans would die without dangerous restrictions on liberty.
3. Even with strict social isolation, 110,000 to 240,000 would die. 

That's what we were told. Many people believed that social isolation for a couple of weeks is worth it to save 2 million lives. 

Very quickly, though, critical thinkers saw that the projections were garbage. At almost every turn, all of the experts were wrong. Within two weeks, the terribly flawed projections originally used to justify lockdown was revised down. After the first downward revision, new downward revisions became a daily occurrence. 

Instead of relaxing the isolation orders, policy-makers made their lockdowns more stringent. Why?
