Before I get to Election Day . . .


#### Join Bill Hennessy at The Creek in Washington, MO


First, a plug.

Wednesday, April 3, 2013, at 5:30 p.m. I will be in Washington, Missouri, and you're invited. I have the high honor and distinct privilege of speaking to the great women of Washington Federated Republican Women. Â at 5:30 p.m. I'll be talking about Heritage Foundation, Heritage Action for America, and Blaine Luetkemeyer's Brain.

The venue is [The Creek Grill and Sports Bar, 200o Phoenix Center, on Highway 100 in Washington](https://www.thecreekgrill.com/contact-the-creek-grill-and-sports-bar-washington-mo.htm). Please stop in if you can. Arrive by 5:30 to get a good seat.


#### You Should Vote On Election Day Because People Depend on You

You are more informed than the average voter. You understand the consequences of increasing taxes and decreasing freedom. Your neighbors, your kids, and your life depend on you getting out and voting April 2. **And whether or not you vote is a matter of public record.**

That's right, whether or not you vote is a matter of public record. **If you want people to take you seriously, you need to vote**. Every political organization looks at the voter rolls to see who voted and who didn't. They cross-tab voters to organization membership. Organizations with high voter turnout get attention. Organizations with low voter turnout get ignored.


#### More Than 200 Tax Increases Are On the Ballot in Missouri on Election Day


That includes an increase in the[ sales tax for St. Louis City and St. Louis County](https://hennessysview.com/2013/03/19/vote-no-on-proposition-p-on-april-2/), school bond issues in [Kirkwood ](https://hennessysview.com/2013/03/18/if-you-vote-in-kirkwood-school-district-listen-up/)and [Rockwood ](https://hennessysview.com/2013/03/21/rockwood-school-district-wants-more-money-but-state-audit-found-it-mismanages-the-money-it-has/)among many.

There are county and municipal office elections.

And every election has consequences.

The easiest way to increase your influence in Jefferson City and Washington DC is to vote and to pool your vote with members of active organizations that vote.
