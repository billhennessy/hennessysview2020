This is a Vine clip of the first explosion at the Boston Marathon. [Fox 25 in Boston](https://www.myfoxboston.com/category/246064/breaking-news-livestream) reported moments ago that organizers confirmed that bombs caused the explosions. Clearly many casualties.

“For the sake of His sorrowful passion, have mercy on us and on the whole world.”
