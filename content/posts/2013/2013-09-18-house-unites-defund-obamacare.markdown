I had no idea this was coming when I wrote [my blog post on gratitude](https://hennessysview.com/2013/09/18/what-happens-when-you-count-your-blessings/) at midnight.

From Heritage Action for America:

In many ways, today’s announcement represents “a victory…for the GOP’s conservative wing and its tea-party allies.”  ([Wall Street Journal](https://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323342404579081560684879076.html#printMode))  However, it also represents a victory for the tens of thousands of workers who have seen their hours cut thanks to Obamacare and to the patients searching for new doctors.

It is also a reaffirmation that Americans outside of Washington can have an impact on the legislative process.[ ](https://www.nationalreview.com/article/358656/movement-strikes-back-robert-costa)[According to National Review’s Robert Costa](https://www.nationalreview.com/article/358656/movement-strikes-back-robert-costa), Heritage Action’s nine-city defund Obamacare tour “drew huge crowds and inspired backers across the country to ask their representatives about where they stood.  ‘A lot of members were put in a corner,’ says a House Republican insider.  ‘They were caught by surprise.’”




I want to claim credit, of course. I really do. Not for advocacy or fighting hard. Most people in this fight work a lot harder than I do. For instance, [Ben Evans of Heritage Action](https://twitter.com/HeritageActMO) was actually on that defund Obamacare tour.

I want to claim credit for saying "thank you" for small wins. I want to think that my little appreciation to Ann Wagner for signing the Graves Bill made a difference.

And it did make a difference. Not to House leadership, but to me. My life became a little better because I recognized a small win and focused less on the big loss I expected.

I don't always follow my own advice. For weeks I'll religiously write down three things that I'm grateful for every day. Then I stop.

I have no idea why I stop, but I know what happens when I do: the little wins stop, too.

So, please, take a moment to use the tweet button or the facebook button or the linkedin button on this post to thank the House Republican leadership for deciding to fight with us. Thank @HeritageActMo, too. Do it for yourself because expressing gratitude will make you happier and improve your relationships. Even your relationship with Congress.
