Harry Reid needs six Republicans to fund Obamacare. Mitch McConnell signed up immediately.

In a statement, [McConnell announced he plans to vote against Obamacare by voting for cloture](https://www.businessinsider.com/ted-cruz-defund-obamacare-plan-government-shutdown-john-cornyn-2013-9), allowing Harry Reid to strike the defunding language from the bill.

McConnell will, of course, vote nay on the final bill. But that's just a gimmick.


### McConnell's slick maneuver is short-sighted. It will bite him. 


Slick Mitch knows as well as anyone that Obamacare is a disaster for the American people. Every day a new story breaks explaining the financial and health destruction Obamacare will bring. Just today, [USA Today reported on the "family glitch" that will throw at least half a million children off of medical insurance altogether](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/09/23/aca-family-glitch-issues/2804017/) while increasing costs dramatically.

As more and more families file for bankruptcy or face foreclosure because of the cost of Obamacare's massive bureaucracy, Americans will remember who fought the law with all their might and who used slick language to let the law proceed.

Slick Mitch McConnell bets you'll forget he voted to fund Obamacare.

Slick Mitch thinks you'll forget he deserted when the fighting started.

**Slick Mitch is in for a rude awakening.**
