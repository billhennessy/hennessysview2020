A commenter to my blog about libertarian kids implies that libertarians are okay—[as long as they’re not, ya know, too libertarian](https://www.redstate.com/billhennessy/2013/03/12/why-libertarian-kids-not-drones-scare-mccain-and-graham/).

The other night at Heritage Tavern I heard debates break out over the definition of “conservative.”

If you’re wondering why the left is kicking our ass, now you know. They’re busy turning Texas blue while we debate the meanings and merits of political labels.

Maybe this country is beyond hope.
