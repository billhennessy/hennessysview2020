There's no such thing as a perfect candidate.




So quit waiting for one, and quit staying at home and casting a protest vote.




We need your help. Who are we you ask? The voters who have been getting their asses handed to them. We have about a hundred years of making up to do and **we need to get started** with a strategy.


If we can elect a candidate that we agree with:



  * 


six out of ten issues. . .we’re over the hump



  * 


seven out of ten issues. . .we’re getting somewhere



  * 


eight out of ten issues. . . we’re winning



  * 


nine out of ten issues. . .we won



  * 


ten out of ten issues. . .we're fooling ourselves




We’re currently operating somewhere between losing and lost.

Even a five out of five currently would be a great start.

Now comes the difficult part: _staying engaged with the elected representative._

Turn the five into a six, the six into a seven. . .etc.

Turn your anger into _action_.

Make sure your elected official knows you are engaged.

**It’s really not that difficult.**

Apply the above formula to every elected office from dog catcher to President of the United States.


Put the burner on simmer and warm until the next election.


Oh, one more thing, if you’re currently staying home and casting a protest vote:

_It’s not working!_
