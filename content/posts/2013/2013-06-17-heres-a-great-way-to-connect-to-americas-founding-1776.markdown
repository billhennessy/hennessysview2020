### Get into the spirit of ‘76 with a great live musical

You probably didn’t know that I was a theatre guy in high school and college. In fact, I was a theatre [![1776-poster](https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/1776-poster_thumb.jpg)
](https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/1776-poster.jpg)major for a couple of years. I think the right’s neglect of the arts is one of our biggest failings. The arts reach people at an emotional level. Intellectual arguments cannot change emotional attachments.

So here’s a chance to rev up your American patriotic spirits while connecting with the arts. It’s [1776, the musical](https://insighttheatrecompany.com/), and a great St. Louis teacher and leader, Jim Leibrecht, is part of the show. Here’s his summary of this play:

> I just wanted to let you know that the production of **__1776 __**opens at Insight Theatre a week from Wednesday, June 26. It runs for 10 of the next 12 days, dark on July 1 and 4. Curtain is at 8:00, 2:00 on Sunday’s. Theatre is on the campus of Nerinx Hall High School.

> **I have to tell you that this is going to be an extraordinary production**. The cast of 20+ is wonderfully talented as actors and as vocalists, and experienced and professional all. From the leads through the delegates to the entire company, **the vocal quality is “awesome”**. Voices are very rich and full, and the characters created are engrossing. (I portray Scottish delegate of Delaware, Thomas McKean, he of the robust and florid personality and voice). This is definitely one of the most exhilarating casts I have ever had the privilege and joy of being part of. Each one’s abilities help one to enrich and flesh out one’s own performance, which means it is a total company and ensemble presentation—doesn’t get any better than that. But all that is so much more wonderful because the libretto and music of the show are just great. **The book is great writing**; the music fully reflective of the characters, the situation. It is just a wonderful musical. AND the miraculous birth of our Declaration and birth is both confounding and inspiring. **The show makes one appreciate what July 4 is really about all the more**.____
