Our old friends John and Gina Loudon appear on ABC’s _Celebrity Wife Swap_ this Thursday, March 28.

A lot of my friends have asked “what were they thinking?”

Dr. Gina explains what they were thinking:



My Take

The Loudons took a big gamble. It’s about time someone did.

Gina is dead on. As [I’ve been saying for awhile](https://hennessysview.com/2013/03/21/we-need-a-stronger-third-eye/), we have to [break out of our affinity bubbles](https://hennessysview.com/2013/03/07/why-being-wrong-can-be-the-best-policy/). That means going to places we might not be accepted.

Want to stick to your affinity bubble? Then don’t bitch when the Democrats dominate the 2014 and 2016 elections, when libertarianism or conservatism or however you brand yourself is a tiny little subset of politics that matters to no one.
