It was one of the [greatest speeches in the history of speaking](https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/mlkihaveadream.htm). It promoted two self-evident goods: freedom and equality.

He spoke first of equality.


> I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal."

I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.

I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.

I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.

I have a _dream_ today!


The equality Dr. King dreamt of was equality of opportunity for blacks.


> We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so, we've come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.


He dreamt of equal protection under the law. He dreamt of a nation with the courage to “live out the true meaning of its creed.”

Since 1963, America has largely erased the evils of racial segregation. We’ve come a long way since the days of Black Only drinking fountains.

But we’ve replaced racial segregation with new, subtler segregation. We’ve allowed an insidious evil to enslave us equally and divide us from the opportunity we were promised. We’ve divided the nation into the elites and the plebes. And we’ve built a pervasive police state to keep the plebes in check.

Between freedom and equality, Dr. King gave freedom the highest honor. He closed with a cry for freedom:


> And so let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire.

Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York.

Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania.

Let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado.

Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California.

But not only that:

Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia.

Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee.

Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi.

From every mountainside, let freedom ring.

And when this happens, and when we allow freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when _all_ of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual:

_                 Free at last! Free at last!_

_                Thank __God__ Almighty, we are free at last!_


White and black are now equally slaves to the elites’ spy network. [The NSA watches your every move](https://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/318515-nsa-admits-analysts-purposefully-violated-privacy-rights), [reports you to the IRS,](https://dailycaller.com/2013/08/08/reuters-irs-manual-instructed-agents-how-to-hide-secret-deansa-intel/) the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, and the [Drug Enforcement Agency](https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/05/us-dea-sod-idUSBRE97409R20130805).

The elites train their spies to cover their tracks, to fabricate evidence trails, to lie to Congress and judges about the way evidence was obtained.

The NSA shares your life’s most private moments with [an increasingly militarized police force](https://www.cato.org/publications/white-paper/overkill-rise-paramilitary-police-raids-america) that kicks down your doors and invades your home. [This police force choreographs these illegal raids intentionally to terrorize its victims](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2301308/Ex-CIA-agents-sue-Kansas-police-raided-suburban-home-drugs--bought-special-equipment-grow-vegetables-indoors.html).

The spying, the SWAT raids, [the dog shootings](https://www.mercurynews.com/ci_23631649/police-shoot-dog-ten-days-later-outrage-still), and the terrorizing tactics are not to protect you; [they’re to protect the Elites from you](https://www.veteranstoday.com/2013/08/19/police-now-can-switch-off-iphone-camera-and-wi-fi/).

Dr. King’s dream—our dream—has become night terrors.

**But we will wake up. **

Today, I have a dream. I dream of a day when governments, created by our will and animated with our power, heel to commands of their creators’ voices.

I dream of a day when we throw open the curtains that hide the government.

I dream of the day when every human—white and black—strives for the respect of his fellow plebes and no longer grovels for the favor of the elites.

I dream of the day our America dream walks.

I dream of the day we own our own lives.

God bless you, Dr. King. Please intercede with Jesus on our behalf that your dream comes true for those you’ve left behind.

Pray for us, Dr. King, that every person finds the character and courage to wake from this terror and reassert his power over government.

Rejoice with us, Dr. King, on that day when every American of every race, creed, and color can stand hand-in-hand and sing:


> Free at last!

Free at last!

Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!
