After the DNCLeak stories, I think Bernie fans deserve a break.

Since you're probably looking for someone to vote for—someone who's anti-establishment and outside the political class—you might be thinking about Trump.

This might help: 25% off[ the ultimate guide to turning from anti-Trump to . . . voting for Trump.](https://hennessysview.com/turning-on-trump/)

I did it. You can, too. My book will help.

To get the 25% discount (that's like $2.50 in your pocket), just give me your email address and vouch that you Feel Berned. I'll email you the discount code and link.
