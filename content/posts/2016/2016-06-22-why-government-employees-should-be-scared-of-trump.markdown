Some people say they're afraid of Donald Trump for bizarre reasons. I've heard he's a dictator, a fascist, a genocidal maniac, and a lousy businessman. If any of that is true, there's no evidence of it, so he must also own all the media already. And the internet. In fact, if Trump is a lousy businessman who managed to bungle his way to a $10 billion fortune, he must really bad at dictatoring, because he hasn't even conquered his home country in 70 years.

Maybe Trump's failure as a businessman stems from those huge inefficiencies in everything he does. Look at his campaign staff for example. Trump has only 70 employees on his campaign, and he operates on less money than a typical candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives according to the New York Times. That's pretty inefficient. So inefficient it took Trump until April to defeat all 16 contenders. Those contenders outspent Trump by hundreds of millions of dollars, mostly on ads bashing Trump.

In the process, Trump spent a couple of pennies for each of his 15 million votes, while his opponents spend thousands for each of theirs. That might be New York efficiency, but Trump's kind of efficiency won't cut it in Washington DC. Not while Paul Ryan's stroking the Speaker's gavel.

Another contrast that highlights Trump's marvelous inefficiency: Hillary Clinton. Crooked Hillary has a campaign staff of 1,000 and tens of millions of dollars on hand for advertising. And her primary campaign was far more efficient, defeating its lone opponent in June.  That's the kind of efficiency Washington expects.

Add it all up and Trump can win with just 10 percent of the money and people as anyone else. Trump needs 90 percent fewer resources than career politicians to do the same work. That's bad news for our nation's number one industry: government.

Imagine if Trump ran the U.S. government on 10 percent of its current staffing and spending, yet still got the job done the way he has in his campaign. Just imagine the unemployment problem if millions and millions of government employees were let go and forced to find jobs in the private sector?

And with the trillions Trump will save from eliminating all those highly efficient government workers, the private sector will be begging for job candidates. Those laid-off federal workers will be stepping right into private sector jobs in a heartbeat now. How inefficient would that be?

And in the private sector, efficiency is very different than it is for government workers. In the private sector, people have to actually earn additional income. They can't just tax their customers more. So, in that sense, leaving the government for private jobs would be a big step down. And all of this is because Donald Trump is so inefficient.

It's no wonder why career government employees like Paul Ryan fear Trump. Trump's inefficiency could make government irrelevent.
