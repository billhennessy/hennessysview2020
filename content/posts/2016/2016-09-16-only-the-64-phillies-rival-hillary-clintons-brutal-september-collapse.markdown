> After the Phillies beat the Dodgers on September 20, they owned a 6.5-game lead over the Reds and Cardinals, who were tied for second place. Philadelphia then hosted Cincinnati for three games, and the visiting Reds won all three. Then the Phillies hosted Milwaukee for four, and the visiting Braves won all four. At the end of that series, the Reds were in first place, a game ahead of the Phillies and 1.5 games up on the Cardinals. The stumbling Phillies rolled into St. Louis, where they were swept by the Cardinals.

What do Hillary Clinton and the 1964 Philadelphia Phillies have in common?

A lot.

Both went into September up 6.

Both ended September clinging for life.

The 1964 Phillies top everyone's list for the worst meltdown in baseball history. Hillary Clinton looks well-positioned to claim the title for **the worst meltdown in political history**. And it couldn't happen to a nicer woman.

How the felon has fallen.

As you remember, [I pointed out some of these headlines](https://hennessysview.com/2016/09/04/trump-surging-up-up-and-away/) from September 2, like [this one from Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/clintons-advisers-tell-her-to-prep-for-a-landslide-227659):



### Hillary's Advisors Tell Her to Prepare for a Landslide





> Advisers to Hillary Clinton’s campaign have identified so many paths to an Election Day victory they are now focusing not only on the one or two battlegrounds that would ensure a win but on opening up the possibility of an Electoral College landslide.



After Trump's visit to Mexico, Politico curbed its enthusiasm by changing the headline to "Clinton advisers see multiple paths to a commanding win." But the storyline remained: Clinton would win in a landslide.

Over the course of just two weeks, **Clinton turned a landslide into a disaster** as her cough and criminal past caught up with her. The email scandal broadened into a Clinton Foundation scandal. And reasonable people (meaning everybody but Democrats and media) openly spoke of Hillary's poor health and low stamina.

To deflect attention from her crime family's underworld ways, she tried calling Trump voters "deplorables" and "irredeemable." (Irredeemable means incapable of redemption. Can't be fixed.)

The line was a disaster because it proved** Trump was right all along: Hillary is a bigot.** Don't believe me? Maybe you never looked up the [definition of ](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bigot)bigot. Lucky for you, I did:



> a person who is [obstinately](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/obstinate) or **intolerantly devoted to his or her own opinions and prejudices**; _especially_ : one who regards or treats the members of a group (as a  [political], racial or ethnic group) with hatred and intolerance



By calling her opponent's supporters both deplorable and irredeemable, Hillary exposed herself as a dictionary definition bigot. She hates those who disagree with her. And, by implication, she wants her followers to hate them, too.

No wonder so many Clinton supporters feel obliged to physically assault Trump voters. Hillary encourages violence against her enemies. Fear of physical violence from Hillary supporters drove Scott Adams to endorse her . . . for his own personal safety. Don't believe me? Here are [Scott's own words published on June 5th](https://blog.dilbert.com/post/145456082991/my-endorsement-for-president-of-the-united-states):



> So **I’ve decided to endorse Hillary Clinton for President, for my personal safety**. Trump supporters don’t have any bad feelings about patriotic Americans such as myself, so I’ll be safe from that crowd. **But Clinton supporters have convinced me – and here I am being 100% serious – that my safety is at risk if I am seen as supportive of Trump**. So I’m taking the safe way out and endorsing Hillary Clinton for president.



Now, of course, the race looks very different than it did September 2. Trump has surged to the lead in Ohio, Florida, North Carolina, Nevada, Colorado, and Iowa. He's poised to take New Hampshire, Virginia, and Michigan—states considered locked away for the Democrats just last week.

While some of the credit goes to Trump's masterful campaigning, a lot of the blame for this slide must rest with Clinton and the Democrats. They overplayed their hand. They decided to use hatred to put Trump away. And the American people have rejected Clinton's bigotry.

It turns out that Colin Powell was right. We learned from his hacked emails that he recognized Clinton's bungling ways when he wrote to a friend:



> **Everything HRC touches she kind of screws up with hubris.**



Hillary's fingerprints are all over the collapse of her campaign. With hubris.
