Many powerful interests around the world loathe Donald Trump and the people who elected him. There's no disputing that.

One of those powerful interests is the Central Intelligence Agency. One of the CIA's own, Evan McMullin, attempted to disrupt the election. Like Bay of Pigs and Saddam's weapons of mass destruction, that CIA plot failed. Even George Will admits the CIA makes some horrible, deadly mistakes. And sometimes those mistakes come from seeing the results they want to see, not the results presented.

Now, the CIA has leaked parts of an alleged, unverified assessment. The Washington Post and New York Times have concluded, based on leaked passages combined with their own imagination of what might be, that the Russian government interfered with the 2016 US election. RNC chairman [Reince Priebus calls the story "insane."](https://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/12/11/reince-priebus-battles-nbcs-chuck-todd-on-russian-election-hacking-chuck-this-is-insane/)

I know former CIA employees who are intelligent, patriotic Americans. I also know that the CIA is a political organization that operates at the pleasure of the President of the United States. You know that the Obama administration used the FBI to advance, not just justice and safety, but the interests of Obama's political party. You  can imagine how Obama has corrupted the CIA.

You also know that many Republicans make their livings from perpetual war. [John McCain and Lindsay Graham](https://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/12/11/mccain-graham-join-democrats-demand-probe-into-claims-of-russian-hacking/) are just two such Republicans. War is their first love.

You've probably heard that military officers hate war. They hate sending their friends and colleagues off to die. They hate writing letters to grieving widows and parents, "your son served his country with honor and distinction. A grateful nation thanks you for your loss." No one wants to write those letters. You would hate it. By appointing a few military generals to his cabinet, Mr. Trump has frightened the American war lovers. They see generals as a threat to perpetual war and to all the money perpetual war earns for them.

Donald Trump poses a serious threat to the war machine built and oiled by McCain, Graham, and the CIA. They all profit from war. And they want more of it.

To be fair, it's possible that [McCain and Graham ](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/12/rino-war-hawks-lindsey-graham-john-mccain-call-investigation-russia-influencing-election/)believe now is the best time for an all-out war against Russia. Russia has been getting stronger while America has been getting weaker. It's as if the US has transferred its military might to the Russians. If McCain and Graham truly believe Russia is building toward a war of conquest against the US, then they probably believe now is our last chance to fight them on something like a level field. So maybe they want war for good reasons in their heads. But they want war with Russia as surely as they want a big fat campaign contribution from Boeing.

The current spasm about the Russia supposedly hacking the US election looks like a pure political hit job.** It looks like a coup attempt.** It was probably developed in the Oval Office and leaked by an Obama appointee in the CIA. And it looks more sinister than merely an attempt to weaken Trump. It's an attempt to overthrow the election and put Trump's supporters in their place. Maybe I'm being paranoid. Maybe not. Either way, pay close attention to the actual facts of this story. Question everything you hear. Especially if the source is the CIA.

_UPDATE_ The [FBI disputes the CIA's conclusion, indicating CIA's "leak" was politically motivated](https://fortunascorner.com/2016/12/11/ciafbi-dispute-russian-involvement-in-u-s-election-suggests-politically-motivated-leak-by-cias-brennan/). (Filed under "I told you so.") Here's more on the [FBI/CIA dispute from Chicago Tribune](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-russian-election-tampering-cia-fbi-20161210-story.html).

_MORE_ [Gateway Pundit reports a UK diplomat refutes the CIA's propaganda](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/12/uk-diplomat-ive-met-dnc-wikileaks-leaker-person-insider-not-russian/). The diplomat met with the Wikileaks source. The source is a DNC insider in the USA, not Russian.

**UPDATE 2** [John Bolton raises possibility of CIA "false flag" operation](https://thehill.com/homenews/309897-bolton-questions-if-russian-hacks-were-false-flag). Bolton told TheHill.com:



> “It is not at all clear to me, just viewing this from the outside, that this hacking into the DNC and the RNC was not a false flag operation,” he told Fox News’ Eric Shawn on Sunday.

When pressed about his use of the phrase “false flag” and whether he was accusing an entity in the U.S. of involvement, Bolton said, “We just don’t know.”

“But I believe that intelligence has been politicized in the Obama administration to a very significant degree.”



Finally, **meet the CIA agent who broke the Russian election hack: Colonel Flagg**.
