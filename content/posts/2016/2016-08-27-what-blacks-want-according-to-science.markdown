If this shocks you, you're probably a racist. I probably am, too.

Blacks want the same things whites want. Well, blacks want the same things non-elitist whites want. And it's been quantified. By a Jew. Here's what he found, as reported by [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/howard-moskowitz-donald-trump-2016-8/#-4):



> His report (featured below) found that black voters care most about **lowering taxes** in their community, having a **strong leader**, creating **jobs**, changing the **tax code to help workers and small businesses**, making **college affordable**, and improving the **financial health of the US**.



Folks, that's what we all want. Those are totally color-blind goals.

There is no racial divide in America. Except the one invented by mainstream media.

This is what I've been telling you for years. People want to work, and they want to enjoy the fruits of their labor.

Here's where it gets dicey: blacks have been conditioned to think Democrats want those same things. But Democrats hate those things. Democrats hate lower taxes, stronger leaders, more jobs, entrepreneurial tax codes, and affordable education. Democrats want the opposite of all those things.

I'm for Trump because Trump wants African-Americans to have better lives. Some say that makes me a racist. But that's okay. I'll accept the "racist" mantle if it means blacks will finally get good jobs and live without the fear of violence. If it's racist to want blacks to live lives as good as mine, then call me racist.
