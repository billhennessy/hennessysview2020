Last week[ I made three bold predictions](https://hennessysview.com/2016/11/12/3-ways-president-trump-changes-everything/) about how Trump would change American culture:




*1. Marriage would rebound, as would the fertility rate
*2. People would dress better
*3. Legacy becomes physical things, not mere laws


Trump's influence on American culture can already be seen in marriage and divorce rates. According to Bloomberg, [divorce is down to 35-year lows](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-17/divorce-in-u-s-plunges-to-35-year-low) and marriage rates began pumping up during the recent campaign.



> The U.S. divorce rate has fallen for the third consecutive year, to its lowest level in more than 35 years, according to [data](https://www.bgsu.edu/ncfmr/resources/data/family-profiles/anderson-divorce-rate-us-geo-2015-fp-16-21.html) released Thursday.

Meanwhile, [marriage is up](https://www.bgsu.edu/ncfmr/resources/data/family-profiles/hemez-marriage-rate-us-geo-2015-fp-16-22.html) a bit, at 32.3 marriages for every 1,000 unmarried women age 15 or older last year, from 31.9 in 2014. It was the highest since 2009, suggesting that, after a plunge of several decades, matrimony could be stabilizing.



You might say, "wait a minute! Trump hasn't even been sworn in." Good point. But Trump's influence on the culture comes from his cultural relevancy. And people have been heavily exposed to Trump since he announced his campaign in June 2015. That's more than a year of psychological impact on the American mind.

If you think people aren't affected by Trump already, ask yourself how many times you've heard people use strange adverbs like "bigly" lately. You don't have to be President to affect the culture. You just have to dominate thought. And Trump dominates thought like no one ever.

By this time next year, people will be talking about a new baby boom. Just [imagine all the new houses these newlyweds will need](https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-11-17/housing-starts-smash-expectations-soar-most-1982).

Pay close attention to my predictions. You can make fun of me if I turn out to be wrong.
