"That's outstanding," said the Great One.



> The Republican leadership in Congress doesn’t have the guts to go to the floor of the Senate or the floor of the House and make these charges. This is outstanding. You can’t let Hillary Clinton get away with her corruption, her cronyism, her criminality. I don’t care who you support or don’t support. She’s detestable.

Mark Levin said some terrible things about Donald Trump. Levin supported Ted Cruz in the primaries. Sometimes he sounded like Glenn Beck wrote his monologues.

But situations change. People change. People turn on Trump.

I can't possibly know if Mark Levin will end up supporting Trump enthusiastically or not. I'm not in Levin's head. But Levin's monologue about Trump's masterful speech on Wednesday feels familiar. I went through a similar turning.

My new book, _Turning On Trump_, walks you through my turn. Whether you're a Never Trumper, a Trump Lover, or somewhere in between, you'll find something to cheer about when you buy _Turning On Trump_. If you're undecided, you will want to find out how one Tea Party leader changed his mind about America's most pressing needs. And if you know someone who needs to hear it's okay to change your mind, buying _Turning On Trump_ as a gift will make you feel wonderful. It's almost effortless.
