FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE



## **Announcing the Greatest Trump Rally Evah!**





### **St. Louis Area Tea Party for Trump, Sunday, August 28 at ****4:00 p.m., Surdyke Harley-Davidson in Festus, MO**



**St. Louis, Missouri** — This is going to be huge, folks, believe me. Huge. You’re gonna wanna be there. Take my word for it.

What, you haven’t heard about the **Tea Party for Trump Rally**? You gotta be kiddin’ me. Sad! Everybody—and I mean ev-er-ybody—has heard about it. Everybody.

It’s this **Sunday, August 28 at 4:00. Surdyke Harley-Davidson in Festus**. You know where that is, I know you do. Surdyke Harley-Davidson. Google it. Everybody knows Surdyke. Wonderful people. Great people. The best.

You know who’s putting this together? Your old friends from the Tea Party:** Ed Martin, Jim Hoft, Michelle Moore, Bill Hennessy. Jamie Allman from 97.1 FM** is gonna be there speaking. You won’t wanna miss it. **Stephanie Rubach**’s speaking. Maybe some others. **Freida Keogh**’s gonna tell you about working the polls, because that’s important. So important, working the polls.

And NFL **Hall of Fame legend Jackie Smith** is gonna sing. Greatest tight end ever, people. Greatest ever. It’s so nice of Jackie to do this, isn’t? Beautiful.

We got so many great friends. Great friends. Unbelievable, really. Unbelievable.

And the **best music you ever heard**, people. Best music. The band **Fully Loaded** will start at 3:30 so you have something to listen to while you’re setting up your folding chairs. You’re gonna love Fully Loaded. Love those guys. Maybe they’ll break up the speechifying, too. I don’t know, but they probably will.

**The speakers start at 4:00 sharp**, so be there and be seated. You won’t wanna miss a word. Not a word. Just grab a bottle of water** thanks to our friend Tim Jones**, and you’ll be all set. But don’t forget to bring a chair.

**Tea Party for Trump** is a project of the Freedom for All PAC. We’re building an army of door knockers and phone callers to target key swing states like Ohio, plus our home states like Missouri and Illinois. You’ll want to help, believe me, you’ll want to help.

And you’ll want to be there, too. Great people. Great music. It’s gonna be a great day. You’re gonna love it. Everybody’s welcome.
