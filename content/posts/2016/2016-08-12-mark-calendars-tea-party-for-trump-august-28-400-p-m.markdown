We're having a Tea Party.

It's time. Everybody's onboard. Now, we need you at the** Tea Party for Trump, Sunday, August 28 at 4;00 p.m. at Surdyke Harley Davidson in Festus, MO**. (Hey, hey, hey—it's only 20 minutes from South County.)  And the band is getting back together (mostly). Expect **many simultaneous Tea Party for Trump events across the country. **

FREE TICKETS ARE LIMITED. [GET YOUR FREE TICKETS NOW](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/tea-party-for-trump-rally-tickets-2832864173?utm-medium=discovery&utm-campaign=social&utm-content=attendeeshare&aff=escb&utm-source=cp&utm-term=listing)

**Ed Martin**, **Michelle Moore,** **Dr. Gina Loudon**, and the **world famous Gateway Pundit, Jim Hoft**, are founding members of the** nationwide[ Tea Party for Trump](https://teapartyfortrump.org).** And I am one of [Tea Party for Trump's](https://teapartyfortrump.org) national spokespersons. (I know, but they couldn't afford union rates.)

We are committed to raising** ground troops to knock doors and make calls in key battleground states** like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, and wherever we can make a difference.

(The South County Republican Club Picnic, originally scheduled for the same time, has been postponed. Again, I apologize for stepping on that event.)

The Festus Tea Party for Trump will **energize support in the St. Louis area**. But we need **volunteers** at the event. If you can help, please **fill out the brief form below**. We will get in touch.

This is coming together fast, so accept my apology if I left something out. It's going to be okay. We will not let Hillary Clinton pick Antonin Scalia's replacement. We will not let Crooked Hillary eliminate the Hyde Amendment.  And we will not debate anyone about the merits of the Republican nominee.




** We are the people who powered the Republican takeover of the **House of Representatives in 2010**.
** We are the people who propelled Republicans to take over the **Senate in 2014**.
** We are here to take the **White House in 2016**.


It's as simple as that. Check out the [Tea Party for Trump Founding Members board](https://teapartyfortrump.org/#team). It's a who's who of original Tea Party organizers from February 2009. In addition to our St. Louis all-starts, there's Michael Patrick Leahy, Christina Botteri, Lloyd Markus, Eric Olsen, Tom Zawistowski, and more.

On a recent conference call, a senior executive with the NRA said, "I've worked alongside the Tea Party, and I've worked against the Tea Party. I can tell you, I don't have any desire work against you folks again.

And that's from one of our friends! Imagine how the other side must feel.

**We're gonna do this, folks. We're gonna do this. **

And we're going to start with this call for volunteers to help at the **Tea Party for Trump at Surdyke Harley on August 28 at 4:00 p.m**. No excuses.
