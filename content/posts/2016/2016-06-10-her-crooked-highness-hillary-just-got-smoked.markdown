Trump is now running unopposed for president because his only opponent is an empty pantsuit.

Hillary Clinton uses other people's money to surround herself with nearly 1,000 paid staff. Direct paid staff. That a HUGE support team for a crooked sexist like Hillary.

Donald Trump spends his own money, so he hires only enough people to get the job done. Trump understands money and people, while Hillary understands comfort.

Tonight, Hillary Clinton exposed herself as an amateur in the world of communication. Just read this and enjoy:

Hat Tip to [Jim Hoft, the Gateway Pundit, for this great exchange](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/06/trump-gets-last-laugh-crookedhillarys-snarky-swipe-twitter/) that probably ended Hillary's political career.

Watching Trump battle Hillary is like watching Sugar Ray Leonard fight a high school kid. It's not even a fair fight. It's embarrassing.

Trump is the Einstein of persuasion, and Hillary couldn't even persuade her husband not to rape women. It's not fair.

That's why [Trump will win in a landslide](https://hennessysview.com/2016/05/13/how-to-predict-trumps-landslide-win/), probably before November.
