Some people on the right say they won't vote for Trump. Those people list various reasons, mostly about his demeanor and things he's said in the past. They think who gets the credit is more important than what gets done. We all know people like that, don't we?

Most of those NeverTrumpers were okay with Trump's policies. They all love his Supreme Court list. Most of them liked Ted Cruz's ideas, and Cruz's weren't far from Trump's. For example, Cruz was for the flat tax, as I am, but Trump only wants to flatten taxes about 60 percent instead of all the way.

I'll take 60 percent when the other choice is 100 percent in the wrong direction.

Yet some of those NeverTrump people still say "never Trump." And they know that Hillary would do great damage to the United States and hurt of all of our citizens. She's like some horrible hemorrhagic virus on freedom and good government. And she's a criminal who loses state secrets. Yet those NeverTrumps prefer that hemorrhagic to fever over all the good things they've said they want, like lower taxes and fairer trade and immigration enforcement.

What NeverTrumpers seem to be saying is, "I want all those things that Trump wants, but I don't want him to get the credit."

Sure, Trump would probably take a lot of credit for 4.2% GDP growth and a drop in crime. I can understand why Bill Kristol and Don Adams would rather see this economic malaise continue forever than to hear Trump say, "I did it my way." Those NeverTrumpers are even okay with paying for abortions as long as it means Trump doesn't get credit for all the kids who don't get chopped up and flushed down a toilet.

"Better to butcher a billion babies than to let Trump save them," say the NeverTrumpers.

It's too bad NeverTrumpers show such disregard for Ronald Reagan.

Reagan let Democrats take a lot of credit for getting his legislation through Congress. Remember, Democrats controlled the House for Reagan's entire administration. As Reagan put it, it's amazing what you can accomplish when you don't care who gets the credit.

If Hillary becomes President, [NeverTrumpers will get the credit they deserve](https://hennessysview.com/2016/10/19/a-catholic-priest-eviscerates-childish-nevertrumpers/). For everything.
