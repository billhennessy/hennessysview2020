Jim Hoft. Ed Martin. John Burns. Dottie Bailey. Ben Evans. Gina Loudon. Lee Presser. Ben Murphy. Phyllis Schlafly.

Those are my friends who were on the Trump Train long before me. If not Day One, Day Two.

I resisted.

I wanted a kinder, gentler conservative. I was for Dr. Ben Carson.

But my friends opened my eyes.

Over time, they reminded me that the Tea Party was never about R vs. D or conservative vs. progressive.

The Tea Party was about the people vs. the elites.

Trump was theÂ champion of the people.

Everybody else was with the elites. Almost everybody.

Once my eyes were opened, I saw.

I see that the American people are wiser than I ever gave them credit for.

Jefferson would be so proud. Reagan, too.

The shining city on the hill glows on.

Well done, America. Well done.

**Make America great again.**

Praise the Lord. Thank you, Saint Phyllis.
