In 20 years, the Catholic Church will be less influential in America than the Cobbler's Guild. 

Why? 

Because for 70 years, the Church hierarchy in America has promoted men of weak character, weak faith, and weak catechetical formation to be pastors, bishops, and cardinals. 

These weak men used the Church's massive wealth to live opulent lives, in many cases, complete with paid sex. 

Hiring male and female prostitutes wasn't enough to gratify the sexual appetites of many of these priests and bishops. So they preyed on the young and on the vulnerable. In particularly, these wicked priests and bishops preyed on seminarians. 

Eventually, as we all know, these thousands of sexual assault victims wanted some compensation for being sexually and psychologically abused. And the church paid. 

To pay for these mounting lawsuits, the church turned to her people. But the people are tapped out. 

Then, the Church started selling assets. That's where we are now. The selling of assets. And the selling of assets means the closing of Catholic schools and parishes. 

If you live in a relatively affluent suburban parish, you probably think, "well, my parish if fine." 

You are wrong, my friend. You are wrong. 

Soon, the multi-millionaire Boomer bishops will retire or die. Behind them is a thin, largely effeminate mini-generation of Gen X priests. And behind them? 

While the Boomer bishops are alive, they will sell assets to maintain their opulent, perverted lifestyles. The Church's property and treasures will hold out long enough for these men to live well until their deaths. 

But then what? 

Come 2035 or so, the number of Catholic parishes in the US will fall by 70 percent. Diocesesan treasures will have been looted and sold off. The number of practicing Catholics will have fallen, so the Church's ability to raise funds will have be non-existent. 

You might say, "but Pope Francis's emphasis on evangelization will reverse the Church's popoulation decline, and the new converts will fix everything."

Hardly. Evangelization without doctrine is mere babbling. The most effective evangelization is strong faith and holiness. With faith and holiness, people will see Christ in you. Without faith and holiness, human ingenuity is useless. 

Most Catholics are faithless. Seventy percent don't believe the most basic tenet of Catholic faith. (Why do you think 70% of parishes will close?)

So, by 2035, with the Church broke, its assets sold, most of its parishes gone, what will happen?

The generation of priests behind the Gen Xers will take over.
