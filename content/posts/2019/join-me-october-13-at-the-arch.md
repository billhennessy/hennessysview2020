## Rosary Coast-to-Coast at the Arch in St. Louis

We are in a spiritual battle for America's soul, and we've been fighting it all wrong.

Politics is important. Christians should engage. But politics isn't enough. And politics isn't first. 

> "For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood; but against principalities and power, against the rulers of the world of this darkness, against the spirits of wickedness in the high places" Ephesians 6:12

Join tens of thousands of Christians worldwide on Sunday, October 13, 2019 starting at 2:30 p.m. on the South Grand Staircase of the Gateway Arch in St. Louis — the same location where we launched the Tea Party in 2009. 

Hear from one of the most powerful homilists in the country, Monsignor Eugene Morris of the Oratory of Ss. Gregory and Augustine. Then join in a global praying of the Glorious Mysteries of the Most Holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary.

We will praying for the most important spiritual battles raging today:

- Renewal of the faith in the United States
- Preservation of the faith in Catholic Church as the Amazon Synod occurs
- Restoration of the family

A downloadable flyer is available here [DOWNLOAD NOW](/images/ST-LOUIS-ROSARY-2019.pdf)

Please download, print, and place int he Narthex of your church.

No Rosaries, no worries. We will have plenty on hand. 

This, folks, is the real battle for America's soul. It's a battle against the powers of this dark world. Our greatest service to humanity is to lead souls away from the fires of hell and toward the eternal beauty of Heaven. And we are powerless without God. 

Please join us:
Sunday, October 13 at 2:30 on the South Grand Staircase of the Gateway Arch.

God bless.
