The Gateway Pundit reports that the US military will police the internet in 2020 to capture, kill, or disable "fake news." 

This isn't good news for Donald Trump and the Republicans. In fact, when I predicted an easy Trump win a few weeks ago, I did not see this coming. All bets are off.

But I'm no longer surprised by anything, so this isn't exactly a shocker. 

### We Are Losing

Whittaker Chambers, upon leaving the Communist Party for, eventually, National Review, lamented that he was leaving the winning side for the losing side. But he did it anyway.

If we're talking exclusively about *this* world, Chambers was right. Without getting all Marxist, the progression of history since the Enlightenment has been a jerky processing toward secular authoritarianism. The most perfect manifestation of secular authoritarianism all occurred in the 20th century: Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, Mao's China. Before that, the French Revolution was the shiny example.

For most of my life, I believed examples of secular authoritarianism were aberrations. I believed that the normal course of events in this world led people toward freedom. 

But I was wrong. 

Left to our own devices, human beings will become like lions. We will kill what we want, dominate the weak, run in fear from the strong, and lead stunted lives of suffering with little hope for improvement. The technology that makes life easy will gradually, then all at once, disappear. 

This slow, then sudden, descent into brutal animal existence is because we are animals. 

We are animals infused with souls, yes. But, since the Enlightenment, we have worked hard to suppress our sacred souls. We have chosen to exercise our free will to unplug from the divine and it ourselves. We have become addicted to the fruit of the tree in the center of garden. We believe we alone know good and evil.

### We Are *Never* Left to Our Own Devices

> Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour. —1 Peter 5:8

Science measures that is measurable and is perfectly ignorant of what is not measurable. And not everything that influences human behavior is scientifically measurable. 

These immeasurable things fall into two categories: the supernatural (of holy spirits) and the preternatural (of unholy spirits). God, the angels, and saints in heaven constitute the supernatural world, the Kingdom of God. Satan and the fallen angels, maybe the damned, make up the preternatural world, or hell. 

Supernatural and preternatural forces surround us everywhere. 

The supernatural calls us to communion through baptism (John 3:5) and living according to the Commandments, which can be summarized as "Love God with all your heart, all your mind, all strength, and all your soul; and love your neighbor as yourself." 

The preternatural calls us to communion with the world through doing what we will. (The fundamental mission statement of Satanism is "do what thou wilt.") 

When we listen to the preternatural, we get what we want in the moment. When we listen to the supernatural, we get what's best for us. 

Supernatural and preternatural forces never sleep. Nor are they constrained by time and space. They surround us every moment. They know our thoughts, our desires, and our fears. 

The supernatural help us to fear nothing but God. The preternatural teach us to fear everything except God. 

So, "left to our own devices" is misleading. We are never left to our own devices (1 Peter 5:8). We are all constrained. We are, as Jean-Jacques Rousseau said, "born free and everywhere in chains." What Rousseau got wrong is the nature of those chains and our choice of who holds the other ends. [We choose our master: God or Satan](https://www.hennessysview.com/2018/08/08/crawling-back-to-happiness-and-freedom/). When we fail to choose between those two masters, the master of this world chooses us. And the prince of this world is Satan (John 12:31 and 14:30). 


### We Are Outgunned

Forces like Antifa are fighting a spiritual war, whether they know it or not. Intentionally or accidentally, they have joined forces with the evil one. They have preternatural help. 

Most of us on the right are fighting a spiritual war with physical. Most conservatives today, if they believe in things beyond science, are reluctant to admit so, even to themselves. While we all like stories of exorcisms and might say we believe in the supernatural (usually conflating supernatural and preternatural), we don't live our lives as if every decision and action were a choice between God and Satan. We rarely call on the supernatural to combat our preternatural enemies. While we might pray that our side wins an election, we mistakenly make the *people* involved the objects of our prayer, rather than the preternatural beasts who influence them and us. By so doing, we are fighting far superior spirit beings with weapons means for our physical rhealm. 

And we are losing ground. 

The internet firmly in the hands of the enemy. Yes, I can blog, but who will know? Twitter, Facebook, and Google can hide my websites. And they do. 

The only way to know what I'm posting on Hennessy's View is to subscribe by email. And that will only work until my hosting provider decides to shut me down. 

We are outgunned because the other side has wittingly or ignorantly joined with an army of spirit warriors. Spirit warriors too numerous to count and more intelligent than humans can understand. 

These spirit warriors operate on human desire and fear. They give us what we want in this life—wealth, leisure, amusement, convenience. 

But the price is high. 

The price is peace. We trade peace and hope for Alexa and episodes of Real Housewives. Because that's what the spirit warriors offer, and that's what our animal brains desire. Bread and circuses.

We lost the internet because the other side is fighting a spiritual war while we are fighting a secular war. They have nuclear weapons and we have spears and rocks. 

### Know Your Enemy

Anyone who's studied demonology, even casually, knows that demons are real and very present. You don't see them, of course. They're preternatural. Science has no instruments to detect them.

But we do. 

We hear them. They influence us

### Lose the Battle | Win the War

Whittaker Chambers was right. He left the winning side for the losing side. The world is the devil's kingdom, and Chambers defected from the devil's army. 

James Burnham was also right. Burnham, another former communist (fellow-traveller, at least) who ended up writing for William F. Buckley's National Review, wrote a book called *The Suicide of the West: an essay on on the meaning and destiny of liberalism*. The book revolves around an old world atlas that shows the reader, in color, the advance and retreat of civilizations throughout history. It was published in 1964 when the advancing civilization was the Soviet Union and Western Civilization was in a panicked retreat.

Times have changed, of course. The Soviet Union disappeared. But Christendom (aka, Western Civilization) is still in retreat. Especially in the United States.
