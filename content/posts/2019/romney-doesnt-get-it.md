Mitt Romney's naïveté is almost cute. He thinks it's still 1982. 

But it's not cute because it's destructive. The world has changed, and [everything is ready to fall apart](https://www.hennessysview.com/posts/2018/how-experts-make-life-worse/). 

See, **Mitt is mad that President Donald Trump hasn't done more to "unite" the country**. Mittens wants the president to be more "unifying." 

Because "trying" to unite the country would solve everything, right? 

But the world has changed. Americans today are as polarized as they were 1861. Just look. 

#### Polarization 1994

#### Polarization 2017

Mittens has probably never looked at these charts of political polarization from the Pew Research firm. These charts show political active Americans, not all Americans. (But those charts aren't much different.) 

Right now, Americans are more divided than they've been since 1861. 

### Silent Abe

From Abraham Lincoln's win in the Electoral Collage (with only 40% of the popular vote) to his inauguration March 4, 1861, Lincoln ignored pleas to say something to "unify" the country. Lincoln knew the country didn't want to be unified and had no intentions of listening to his pleadings. 

In 1861, half of the politically active Americans *hated* the other half. **Hated**. Kumbaya sentiments from a president-elect who received just 40% of the vote and that from only Northern states would not heal the wounds and mistrust of a nation divided. Lincoln knew this. 

Trump knows it now.

### We Are Too Divided for Words

People like Mitt Romney and his ilk think unifying words will unite people. They won't. 

Look again at that 2017 graph of polarization in America. Most active Democrats are Stalinists. Stalinists. Most active Republicans are to the right of Pat Buchanan. The middle ground is like the middle ground between German and French trenches in World War I. America is a vast series of Flanders Fields. 

So, sure, Trump could say a bunch of kumbaya stuff. Antifa would still stone and pepper-spray Republicans. The incoming communist freshmen Democrats would still demand reparations for "gender crimes." The left would still demand a final solution to the conservative problem. (We've seen this movie before.)

Romney thinks gentle words will soften the left. They won't. 

I won't say what will. I won't advocate for it. Eternity is more important to me than America. (Sorry.)

### Choose a Side; There Is No Middle

The center didn't hold. [The centre cannot hold](https://www.hennessysview.com/2016/01/10/the-centre-cannot-hold/).

I chose Jesus. I cheer for the right, but I chose Jesus. My soul. I'm not willing to lose my soul for any side in this battle, but I'm rooting for the right. I'm rooting for Trump. 

Despite all his flaws, President Trump defends my faith and Christ Jesus while others, including Paul Ryan and many Catholic bishops, seek peace with (and approval of) the world, even when the world requires war against God in return. 

If you're on the side of the right, Jim Hoft, the Gateway Pundit, is organizing a [Rally for Trump and the Wall](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2019/01/huge-news-rally-saturday-support-president-trump-border-security-and-the-wall-clayton-mo-at-1-pm-ct/) in [Clayton's Memorial Park](https://www.stlouisco.com/ParksandRecreation/ParkPages/Memorial) this Saturday, January 5, at 1:00 p.m.

#### Flanders Fields
By John McCrae

In Flanders fields the poppies blow
    Between the crosses, row on row,
  That mark our place; and in the sky
  The larks, still bravely singing, fly
Scarce heard amid the guns below.

We are the Dead. Short days ago
We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,
  Loved and were loved, and now we lie
*In Flanders fields.

Take up our quarrel with the foe:
To you from failing hands we throw
  The torch; be yours to hold it high.
  If ye break faith with us who die
We shall not sleep, though poppies grow
*In Flanders fields.
