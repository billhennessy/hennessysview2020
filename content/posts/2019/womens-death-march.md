On Friday, many beautiful people marched for life in Washington DC and other cities.

On Saturady, some ugly women marched for death. 

We are fighting a spiritual war. On our side are Jesus, Moses, Elijah, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all the angels and saints.

On the enemy's side are the National Organization for Women, the National Education Association, CNN, MSNBC, the DNC, and all those ugly feminists. Ugly souls. Cancerous hearts.
