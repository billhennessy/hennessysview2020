Twitter and Facebook and Google are trying to remove all conservatives from their social media platforms. So many people come to this blog by clicking links on those platforms, I'm afraid you will never know when I'm posting unless you subscribe now. 

I'll try to keep you informed and entertained. Maybe I'll introduce you to some tricks to make life easier. Like [new books by John Braddock on how to think like a spy](https://www.hennessysview.com/posts/2019/2019-07-19-a-spys-guide-to-taking-risks-a-book-you-need-to-read/). 

So, please, subscribe before the Twitter police ban me. And tell a few friends to do the same.

Thanks,
Bill
