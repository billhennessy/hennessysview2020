Maybe the Catholic church requires priests to fail some Iowa Test of Basic Courage in order to become a bishop. 

Let's just say the last month has made the Church's  "shepherds" look a lot more like bleating goats. For the most part, our bishops and cardinals seem like timid, **lukewarm Catholics who put secular approval above salvation of souls**. Certainly above defending the Church's teachings. 

The two clearest examples of episcopal cowardice were the reactions to the **Covington Catholic** incident and reactions to **New York's murderous pro-abortion law**. 

### Covington Catholic

When anti-Catholic activists surrounded and harassed a group of high school boys from Kentucky who traveled to Washington for the National Pro-Life March, their "shepherd" sided against them. Bishop Foys. 

Bishop Roger Foys (the lion-hearted?) of Covington Diocese in Kentucky. What a shepherd, huh? 

Within hours of the fake news story breaking, **Bishop Foys fed his sheep to the wolves to save his own skin**. 

Within 24 hours of Foys's betrayal of those fine young men, he knew that the initial reports were fake news planted to make Catholics and pro-lifers look bad. What did Foys do?

Nothing. He hid. He dodged. He took down his diocese's social media accounts. **Bishop Foys ran from the wolves while they picked over the boy's bones.** 

Then, on Friday afternoon, more than five days after learning the accusations against his students were false, Bishop Foys issued a half-hearted apology designed to get the conservative wolves away from him. 

In his apology (which is so pathetic I won't repeat is here), Bishop Foys says his initial condemnation of his sheep was done in "good will" based on the information he had at the time. 

Good will? What church does he belong to? Since when is it good-anything to believe the anti-Christian, pro-abortion, secular news media over 15-year-old Catholics who spend their time and money to attend pro-life marches? 

And why did you hide, Bishop Foys? Why did you hide for a week while the boys twisted in the wind? 

**You fed your sheep to the wolves, Bishop Foys, and you justified your sin**. 

Cowardice before the enemy.  

### Timothy Cardinal Dolan's Social Calendar

Next, we look to New York state where the pride of Ballwin, Missouri, Timothy Dolan, has effectively endorsed the most radical infanticide-enabling law in the western world. 

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, an alleged Catholic, signed into a law a bill allowing infanticide up to the moment the cord is cut during a live birth. In response, the senior Catholic clergyman in the state, Timothy Cardinal Dolan, archbishop of New York City, refused calls to publicly excommunicate Cuomo.

Cardinal Dolan's reasoning is opaque, and it comes down to, "I just don't want to." 

Father [Richard Heilman demonstrates the absurdity of Dolan's cowardice and avarice in this post](https://www.romancatholicman.com/bishops-no-more-crouching-behind-your-cars-while-lives-are-lost/):

> You, conveniently, use crafty language to avoid stepping on “ruling class” toes: “We don’t want to weaponize Communion. We should not use excommunication as a weapon.” Please, do not twist Catholic teaching, to keep protected behind your proverbial car. Excommunication is meant to “save souls.” It is meant to send a very loud and scary message to the sinner that he/she needs to make a 180 turn in order to avoid eternal damnation. And, it sends a very clear message to onlookers that this matter is extremely serious, and so please don’t support it in any way … stay clear!


Apparently, **Dolan doesn't want to be *disinvited* from all the cool New York social events organized by the anti-Catholic secularists**. The worldly leftists will tolerate pro-abortion words from a worldly archbishop, but never a pro-life *action*. 

So, **Cardinal Dolan implicitly endorses New York's infanticide law** by refusing to take *action* against the Catholics who enabled it. 

So sad. 

### Where Have All the Cowboy Bishops Gone?

I realize there are some good bishops out there. But they're few and far between. All I'm asking for is some bishops and archbishops to whom we can point and say, "there, young man, be like him!" Why can't we have a few John Wayne bishops? Or Cardinal Shanes?

I know that only the pope can discipline bishops. **But it's high time the good bishops ostracize their cowardly brethren** until the yellow clergy man up or get out. 

Neither the Church nor the United States can afford **shepherds who feed their sheep to wolves** to save their own skin and comfort.

### A Simple Prayer for Courageous Bishops

Today's gospel (in the traditional lectionary) is Matthew 8:23-27. Jesus and the apostles were in a boat when a storm blew up. The Apostles were terrified, but Jesus was asleep. The Apostles, in fear for their lives, woke Him. He said, "Why are you fearful, O ye of little faith?"

I'm sure that **Bishop Foys and Cardinal Dolan are sincerely afraid of defending the faith in a violently secular world**, just as the Apostles were afraid of the storm at sea. 

Keep that in mind as we look at another story in the Bible, when the Apostles were in a boat on the Sea of Galilee. This occasion was after the Resurrection, in John 21.

The Apostles spotted the risen Christ on the shore and pulled in. They ate some of their incredibly large catch with Jesus. After they ate, Jesus asked Peter, the man destined by God to be the first pope and Bishop of Rome, the same question three times: Peter, do you love me?

Each time, Peter answered "yes." 

And each time, Jesus responded to Peter's "yes" with a variation of a similar command:

1. "Feed My lambs."
2. "Tend My sheep."
3. "Feed My sheep." 

Then, according to John, Jesus foreshadow's Peter's martyrdom, saying, "Follow me!"

Follow me! 

Follow me to the cross!

**Feed My lambs, tend My sheep, feed My sheep, and follow Me to the cross!**

That's the mission Jesus gave His first bishops, and it's the mission of every bishop who follows them, including Foys and Dolan. To feed the lambs, tend the sheep, and follow Christ to the cross. Jesus knew doing so would take tremendous courage. Peter, after all, was crucified upside-down.

Bishop Foys and Cardinal Dolan seem in no danger of Peter's fate. They neither feed the lambs nor tend the sheep, so following Christ to the cross seems out of the question. For now, at least.

But maybe there's hope for them. 

Maybe they just need some prayer power from us. Lowly prayer power from the least in the Church's hierarchy. Prayer from the pews directed at the pulpit. 

So here's the little prayer I've come up with. It's probably pretty bad, but I'm just a lowly pew-dweller.  

> O my Jesus, you commanded your first bishops to feed your lambs and tend your sheep even if it meant death by crucifixion.  Give our bishops the courage you gave your Apostles on Pentecost. Fortify our shepherds to become the kind of men we tell our sons to imitate. Lord, through the intercession of the Immaculate Heart of the Blessed Virgin Mary, receive our prayer and give them courage. 

If you like this prayer, please say it every day for 9 days.
