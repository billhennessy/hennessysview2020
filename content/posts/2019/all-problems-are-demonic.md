A friend commented on a recent blog of mine that he misses my political analysis. So I need to make this clear: my political analysis is that all problems in the world are demonic in nature.

I'll write that again so no one's confused: all problems, including all political problems, are demonic. Stop inviting Satan and the demons out of the abyss God made for them, and problems go away. 

I'll go further: if you're more concerned about politics than about preternatural attacks, you're on a fool's errand. You're ignoring the Bible. You're doing exactly what Satan wants you to do and the opposite of what God wants you to do. 

No matter how good of a person you are, no matter how much compassion you have for others, no matter how much you pray or give to the needy or rescue stray animals, if you're not fighting the spiritual battle against Satan, you are *not* fighting the enemy. And, if you're too busy fighting *your* battles, you're probably assisting the enemy's advance. I made this mistake most of my life, while I wasn't just enoying the fruits of the forbidden tree. 

And *that*, my friends, is my final political analysis. And I am not alone. 

In his introduction to *God and Man at Yale*, William F. Buckley wrote that (paraphrased) the battle between individualism and collectivism, freedom and Communism, is the same battle as between good and evil, God and Satan, except on a different plane.

When Buckley wrote those words, the United States was still a Christian country. But its universities were not. Buckley warned us almost 70 years ago that, if we did not fight Satan and his collectivist cohorts in the universities, we end up fighting them in our living rooms. 

We didn't listen. The Devil is at the door. 

In 1950, Buckley believed that political power of Christians and Orthodox Jews could be enlivened, activated, and aimed at the universities and government agencies. That, he believed, would be enough to stop Satan in his tracks and reverse the tide in our schools. But the opposite happened. Therefore, we must conclude that either, a) Christians and Jews were not adequately activated, or b) Buckley fought on the wrong plane. 

When the Tea Party started, I still believed the former was the problem. That not enough people were active enough. But history proves otherwise. At the Tea Party's peak, 20 million Americans were involved or supporting. That's a higher percentage than those who fought or supported the Revolutionary War. 

And, still, we lost ground. 

Why?

Because I believe we were fighting the wrong battle. We were fighting on the wrong plane. We were fighting almost exclusively the symptoms, not the disease. In other words, Buckley was wrong about how to attack the evil one. 

The disease that afflicted academia in the 1950s is now stage four throughout every level of education. It has spread to the news and entertainment worlds. It has consumed the arts. It has swallowed whole one major political party and bitten off chunks of the other. It has taken down most of Western Europe. 

And it has a name. 

While we were fighting the evil one's useful idiots, the evil one was seducing our children. 

While we were placing our faith in creatures and their tenacity, we were losing ground to a pure spirit whose intellect and power dwarfs those of all humans combined. As the Apostle warned:

> For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood; but against **principalities and powers**, against **rulers of the world of this darkness**, against the **spirits of wickedness in high places**. (Ephesians 6:12)

And, as I've quoted so often, Paul offers our solution:

> Therefore, **take unto you the armor of God**, that you may be able to **resist in the evil day** [today], and stand in all things perfect.

Remember, in about 67 *Anno Domini* when Paul wrote that, there were plenty of evil political problems in the Roman Empire. Beginning with the Roman Empire itself. Did Paul tell the Ephesians to rally against the Caesar? No! He told them to get right with God, to follow Christ, to live well, and prepare for battle against Satan and the demons!  

Are we better than first century Christians? Are we somehow so holy now that we can turn our attentions to problems of creatures? 

Now, we have no viable, long-term political options, anyway. [After Trump, the deluge](https://www.hennessysview.com/posts/2019/last-post-from-hennessys-view/). 

So where do we turn?

We turn to Christ, just as the first-century Christians did. But how? 

We start, of course, with sacramental confession, repentance, and prayer. We have to get our lives right. 

But what kind of prayer? 

Deliverance prayers. 

Deliverance prayer prayers are the kinds exorcists use to command and bind demons. But they're also available to the laity. The Catholic Church provides certain deliverance prayers specifically for use by the laity in combatting demons who afflict them. While the laity are limited in their ability to command demons, the deliverance prayers are powerful, nonetheless. 

Here's a pair of deliverance prayers (with no mention of the Blessed Mother) from Fr. Mark Ripperger's book, *Deliverance Prayers For Use by the Laity*:

### Sealing Prayer for Protection
*The person seals himself*:
> I ask Jesus to seal me in His Most Precious Blood against any and all incursions of the evil one, in particular against any clinging, familial, familiar, or retaliating spirits, in the Name of the Father and of the Son [sign of the cross] and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.

### Prayer of Command

*This prayer has been modified for use by the laity*:

> In His Name and by the power of His Cross and Blood, I ask Jesus to bind any evil spirits, forces, and powers of the earth, air, fire, or water, of the netherworld and the satanic forces of nature. By the power of the Holy Ghost and by His authority, I ask Jesus Christ to break any curses, hexes, or spells and send them back to where they came from, if it be His Holy Will. I beseech Thee Lord Jesus to protect us by pouring Thy Precious Blood on us (my family, etc.) which Thou hast shed for us and I ask Thee to command that any departing spirits leave quietly, without disturbance, and go straight to Thy Cross to dispose of as Thou sees fit. I ask Thee to bind any demonic interaction, interplay, or communications. I place *N.* (person, place, or thing) under the protection of the Blood of Jesus Christ which He shed for us. Amen.

In a future post, I will explain why the Catholic Church is both the cause of many of our current problems. I'll also explain why the Catholic Church is our own way out.

Pray and stay tuned. In the meantime, watch this interview with a Catholic witness of the satanic mass recently held in Ottawa:
