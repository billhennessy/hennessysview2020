Unless the redacted name is "Dolan," expect the archbishop of New York City to be relieved soon.

### A First

Perhaps for the first time ever, an American Catholic cardinal has outed a fellow cardinal for protecting an accused sex offender priest.

In a letter to the papal nuncio to the United States, Boston Cardinal-Archbishop O'Malley has warned the Vatican that the archdiocese of New York is harboring a credibly accused pedophile priest. 

### The Players

**Cardinal Sean O'Malley** is the archbishop of Boston. He is also the head of the Vatican's Commission for the Protection of Minors. 

**Cardinal Timothy Dolan** is the archbishop of New York City. He is also a native St. Louisan who grew up with my cousins in Holy Infant parish in Ballwin. 

**Father Donald Timone** is a Catholic priest whose case in under review in the New York archdiocese. According to [National Catholic Register](http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/cardinal-omalley-informs-papal-nuncio-of-concerns-after-times-bombshell-on):

> Father Timone is accused of sexually abusing two teenage boys during the late 1960s and early 1970s. On Dec. 20, the New York Times reported Father Timone was allowed to continue to publicly minister as a priest despite allegations made against the priest, and a 2017 settlement with two of Father Timoneâ€™s alleged victims, one of whom was represented by his widow after succumbing to suicide. The priest was prohibited from ministry shortly after the Times report was published.
