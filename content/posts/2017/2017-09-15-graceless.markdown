Not often does a person or an event fit every definition of a single word. But Hillary Clinton's life after the election fits perfectly all three definitions of _graceless._

__

Graceless.

Graceless Hillary.

Why didn't Donald Trump think of that one during the campaign. "Graceless Hillaryâ€¦"

Not a single rational being could challenge the accuracy of that monicker. Graceless Hillary.

Clumsy.

No sense of propriety or decency.

Inferior or clumsy in treatment or performance.

All describe Graceless Hillary Clinton.

You know Hillary's crimes.

You know Hillary's excuses.

You know Hillary stole the White House silverware when she left in 2001.

You know Hillary is graceless.

Graceless Hillary.

May she find grace. And soon.
