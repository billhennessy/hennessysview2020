**You can actually FEEL America getting GREAT again!**

ADP payroll report shows President Trump made a big down payment on his promise to be the **greatest jobs president ever. **

The economy added nearly 300,000 new jobs last month. Economists expected a rise of 190,000. [It was the biggest jump in jobs in 6 years.](https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-03-08/trump-effect-adp-employment-surges-near-most-6-years-record-goods-producing-job-gain)

The jobs were the good kind of jobs Trump talks about: manufacturing, mining. **Jobs with grit**. Not a lot of waitresses and bartenders.

According to [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/08/private-sector-jobs-february-2017-adp.html):


> Companies added jobs at a blistering pace in February, with** a notable shift away from the service-sector positions that have dominated hiring for years, according to a report Wednesday.**

. . .

In addition to the **construction** and **manufacturing** positions, **mining** and **natural resources** also contributed 8,000 to the total. Trump has promised to restore mining jobs as well.

**The year is off to a sizzling start for job creation**, according to the ADP counts. January added 261,000 positions, a number that was revised upward from the originally reported 246,000.

**"Confidence is playing a large role**," Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, told CNBC. "Businesses are anticipating a lot of good stuff — tax cuts, less regulation. They are hiring more aggressively."


When people have to choose between one of many great jobs or many great, fulfilling careers, a lot of the trivial issues will disappear. But for today, let's just say "Thank you, President Trump."
