To liberals, the murder of a Republican is like the swatting of a mosquito. They oppose violence in theory, but they also want the pest dead. **They're just too lazy to get out of their easy chairs to do it themselves.**

Cass Sunstein, a leftist who's happy whenever a conservative dies early, wrote a book called Nudge. It's a good psychology book. Nudge is about persuasion, which is my chief interest. Sunstein teaches people how to get others to swat mosquitoes for us.

The mainstream media revereÂ Sunstein. The right hates Sunstein. The left applies Sunstein's science to manipulate people from a distance. Like swatting mosquitoes without leaving your easy chair. Conservatives, on the other hand, pooh-pooh psychology and neuroscience. They think it's voodoo or witchery.

Because the leftist media like **CNN, Washington Post, New York Times, and MSNBC use psychology**, they can influence their fringe to attack and kill conservatives. They're very good at psychology.

Today, we saw a fringe leftist shoot at 30 Republican members of Congress and their staffers. It happened on a baseball field in Virginia. The shooter was a 66-year-old man from Belleville, Illinois. His name was James T. Hodgkinson. **Hodgkinson was radicalized by the mainstream media.** And I think [they radicalized him on purpose](https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/06/14/scalise-shooter-dead-gunman-idd-as-trump-hating-building-inspector-from-illinois.html).

See [Scott Adams explain his brilliant "radicalized" meme](https://www.pscp.tv/ScottAdamsSays/1RDGlZqrLyDxL?t=0).

**The media actually celebrated Hodgkinson's attack** on the unarmed Republicans, until they tried to erase the incident with a lie. For example, [The Gateway Pundit noticed](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/06/writer-wapo-attempts-justify-shooting-elected-representatives-radicalleft/) that a Washington Post reporter justified the shooting on Twitter.

Cass Sunstein would be proud. Sunstein probably shot (no pun) Harris a note congratulating him on great persuasion technique. **Malcolm Harris radicalized the next James T. Hodgkinson**.

Earlier, [The Gateway Pundit pointed out how Daily Kos](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/06/founder-left-wing-vox-congressman-shot-republicans-getting-want/) founder Markos Moulitsas programmed his minions to believe Republican deserve to be shot.

Finally, as I predicted at about 1:00 this afternoon, the Washington Post invented five unnamed, anonymous sources to smear Trump and knock **the radicalized James T. Hodgkinson** off the front page. WaPo posted a mostly fabricated story about Robert Mueller shifting his investigation from Russian election tampering to obstruction of justice.

That's another Sunstein move: **waving shiny objects to distract the gullible**.

I'm not that gullible. I know their game because it's a game I study and play in a different way.

Unlike Washington Post and the left's mainstream murder advocates, **I use persuasion to help get what they want.** Like a personal trainer. But the techniques are the same whether they're used for good or evil.

The left uses psychology for manipulation, **to radicalize its fringe.**

Just thought you should know.

This is what it looks like when the MSM succeeds in radicalizing leftists.



Mark Steyn explains just how vile and hateful the left has become.
