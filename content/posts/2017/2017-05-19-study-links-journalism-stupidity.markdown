From the "we could have told you that" department:



> **Journalists' brains show a lower-than-average level of executive functioning**, according to a new study, which means they have a below-average ability to regulate their emotions, suppress biases, solve complex problems, switch between tasks, and show creative and flexible thinking. [emphasis added]



It's okay to laugh. You suspected that reporters are kind of dumb. Now you know. They can't keep up with Trump, but they probably can't keep up with a young adult novella, either.

The [Business Insider story](https://www.businessinsider.com/journalists-brains-function-at-a-lower-level-than-average-2017-5) gets even better:



> **The results showed that journalists' brains were operating at a lower level than the average population, particularly because of dehydration and the tendency of journalists to self-medicate with alcohol, caffeine, and high-sugar foods.** [emphasis original]



The next time you're tempted to get mad a journalist, don't. Instead, feel the kind of pity one feels for the ignorance of animals.
