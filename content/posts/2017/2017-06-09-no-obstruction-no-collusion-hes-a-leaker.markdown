Scott Adams pointed out the linguistic brilliance of Donald Trump's perfect summation of James Comey's failed takedown attempt.

"No obstruction. No collusion. He's a leaker."

That's how Trump summarized Comey's testimony to the Senate's Russian Conspiracy Hoax Committee.

Scott is a genius in persuasion and psychology. Everything he just said about Trump's linguistic kill-shot is dead-on accurate. Trump destroyed Comey without firing a shot. "No obstruction. No collusion. He's a leaker."

Comey is a lawyer with a limited vocabulary. Trump has the best words. We just saw the two of them side-by-side, and Trump destroyed his rival.

I predict Comey will plead guilty before Christmas to avoid time in prison. You can mock me if I'm wrong. But wait until December 26 just so you don't look foolish.

Comey's crime? He freely admitted it under oath yesterday. Robert Mueller will expand his investigation to cover this crime soon.

UPDATE: Trump's lawyer filing[ DOJ IG complaint against Comey](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/06/report-trumps-lawyer-file-complaint-doj-comey-leak/). The IG will forward the complaint to Robert Mueller. My prediction is already coming true.

UPDATE 2: I bought 100 shares of YES on PredictIt. [You can, too](https://www.predictit.org/Contract/6876/Will-a-federal-criminal-charge-be-filed-against-James-Comey-in-2017#data).
