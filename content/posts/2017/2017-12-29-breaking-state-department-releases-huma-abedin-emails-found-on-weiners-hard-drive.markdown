The US Department of State released 2,800 emails involving Hillary aid Huma Abedin that were found on Anthony Weiner's hard drive last year, Judicial Watch reports. You can read all the emails here: [FOIA Abedin Emails](https://foia.state.gov/Search/results.aspx?searchText=*&beginDate=&endDate=&publishedBeginDate=20171229&publishedEndDate=20171229&caseNumber=)

In [a statement, Judicial Watch](https://www.judicialwatch.org/press-room/press-releases/judicial-watch-statement-state-department-release-huma-abedins-government-documents-weiners-laptop/), which forced the release through lawsuits, said this:



> This is a major victory. After years of hard work in federal court, Judicial Watch has forced the State Department to finally allow Americans to see these public documents. It will be in keeping with our past experience that Abedin’s emails on Weiner’s laptop will include classified and other sensitive materials. That these government docs were on Anthony Weiner’s laptop dramatically illustrates the need for the Justice Department to finally do a serious investigation of Hillary Clinton’s and Huma Abedin’s obvious violations of law.

It looks like the State Department's document site is broken. Search for "Abedin" returns zero results.

Hennessy's View will look for smoking guns. Developing . . .
