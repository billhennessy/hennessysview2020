You kind of knew how the story would end. How the search for the 10 missing sailors would end.

This morning, we began hearing about bodies discovered on board the McCain and in waters near the collision. I grieve for those families.

The news breaks a lot of hearts. Especially the hearts of people with loved ones deployed on ships in dangerous waters.

I know my readers never forget the work our military does. Let's just keep it that way.

Eternal rest grant unto them, O Lord. Let the perpetual light shine on them. May their souls and all the souls of the faithful departed rest in peace.
