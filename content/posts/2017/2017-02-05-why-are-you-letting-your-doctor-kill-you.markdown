_If you're overweight, have high cholesterol, diabetes, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, heart disease, or cancer, it's probably not your fault. You've been told to eat poison your whole life, by people who are supposed to know better. Here's some truth to set you free._

Actually, I don't know why. But it's happening to you and millions of other people. **Doctors are killing their patients**. And they're getting a lot of help from the government and big agriculture. Plus the advertising industry.

The more you research diet and nutrition, the more you realize **grains and sugar are deadly**. In fact, eliminating grains and sugars from your diet could lead to all these **wonderful**, **happy** outcomes:




** Pretty face and skin that people want to stare at
** Cover-model body that people drool over
** Lower risk of [cancer](https://thequantifiedbody.net/water-fasts-as-a-potential-tactic-to-beat-cancer/)
** Little fear of Alzheimer's
** Unlikely problems with Parkinson's
** Near zero chance of diabetes
** No chance of obesity
** Little risk of [epileptic seizures](https://www.drperlmutter.com/new-study-validates-ketogenic-diet-epilepsy-treatment-adults/)
** Reduced risk of heart disease
** Resilience in case of food shortages


Now, those intrusive registered dieticians and your family doctor will tell you this is all poppycock. And yet** their waiting rooms are full of sick people** who follow their directions that lead to disease and obesity. Maybe those "experts" are ill-informed. Maybe they're worried that too many healthy people will put them out of business. Maybe they're influenced by big drug companies, health insurance companies, hospital chains, and food industry lobbyists.

As Derek Sivers wrote in [the best business book I ever read](https://amzn.to/2l8mDFF):



> But even well-meaning companies accidentally get trapped in survival mode. A business is started to solve a problem. But if the problem was truly solved, that business would no longer be needed! So the business accidentally or unconsciously keeps the problem around so that they can keep solving it for a fee. (I don't want to pick on anyone's favorite pharmaceutical company or online productivity subscription tools, so let's just say that **any business that's in business to sell you a cure is motivated not to focus on prevention.**)



_Sivers, Derek (2011-06-29). Anything You Want (pp. 31-32). AmazonEncore. Kindle Edition._

But whether it's ignorance or malice, the people who are supposed to make healthy have a business model that first requires you to get sick. And it doesn't have to be that way.

Even the **US National Institutes of Health recognizes that the high fat, low carbohydrate is effective for everything** I listed above. And maybe even more. Not only that, the high fat, low carbohydrate diet is safe for the long haul. Also known as the **ketogenic diet, the tasty habit of eating everything** that's low in carbohydrates has been recognized for 80 years as preventive for epileptic seizures. But for decades doctors told patients to avoid the diet because they thought it would cause heart disease. They were wrong, and they still are.

According to the National Institutes of Health, **you can and should eat a ketogenic diet**. [Here's their conclusion](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2716748/):



> The present study shows the **beneficial effects of a long-term ketogenic diet**. It significantly **reduced the body weight and body mass index** of the patients. Furthermore, it **decreased the level of triglycerides, LDL cholesterol and blood glucose,** and **increased the level of HDL cholesterol**. Administering a ketogenic diet for a relatively longer period of time **did not produce any significant side effects in the patients**. Therefore, **the present study confirms that it is safe to use a ketogenic diet for a longer period of time than previously demonstrated**.



And this was from a 2004 study. Moreover, this study isn't alone. As[ the authors point out:](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2716748/)



> It is generally believed that high fat diets may lead to the development of obesity and several other diseases such as coronary artery disease, diabetes and cancer. This view, however, is based on studies carried out in animals that were given a high fat diet rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids. In contrast, **our laboratory has recently shown that a ketogenic diet modified the risk factors for heart disease in obese patients** ([12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2716748/#b12-ecc09200)).



But what about Parkinson's and Alzheimer's? Scientists have known for years that ketones in the blood strengthen your brain. Recent studies show that people with type II diabetes, usually caused by eating too many carbohydrates, almost DOUBLES your chances of getting [Alzheimer's](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4265876/) or [Parkinson's](https://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/30/4/842) disease.

I know your doctor and the government and dieticians bombard you with bad science. I know that society will ostracize you for eating a diet that's _actually_ good for you instead of the one advertisers tell you is good for you. But part of our philosophy involves personal responsibility, and personal responsibility includes health. I realize that if everyone adopted a ketogenic diet, many big companies would be in trouble. All the companies that make breakfast cereal, bread by the warehouse, sugary drinks, and all those falsely labeled "healthy" low-fat snacks--they'll all be out of business. And so many cardiologists, personal trainers, dieticians, endocrinologists, and pharmaceutical companies will suffer. So will health insurance companies who make their millions by processing paperwork for sick people. Not to mention big hospital chains. Even Walmart will suffer when nobody shops in their 99 aisles of sugary, grain-packed poison. Kellogg's will be as sick as Sears.

The trade-off is obvious:** we can all be fat, unhappy, and sick**, or t**hose people feeding us poison** and its ineffective antidotes can find something more productive and useful to do.

P.S. I do not receive any compensation from the Diet Doctor. (But I wouldn't turn it down.)
