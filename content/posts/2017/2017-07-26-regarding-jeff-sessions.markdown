I campaigned for and voted for Donald Trump. I stand 100% behind Trump today.

I support Trump because he's a fighter. He's a man of action. Trump prosecutes his causes, he doesn't navel gaze.

Jeff Sessions is a good man. He's a good Washington man. He has standards of decorum. Standards I admire.

Trump has no standards of decorum. But I voted for Trump because history has made decorum a liability, even a vice. Decorum accomplishes much in times of relative harmony. Decorum opens to the door to destruction in times like these.

If Trump wants Sessions, I'm for Sessions.

If Trump wants someone else, I trust Trump's judgment.

Just my opinion. I could be wrong. But if you think harder about this than I do, you're navel gazing.
