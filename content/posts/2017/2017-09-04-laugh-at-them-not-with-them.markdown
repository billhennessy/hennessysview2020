The left is crying. One guy on twitter is nearly suicidal. [Hoft has more](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/09/trump-trolls-hillary-clintons-book-launch-liberals-wet/).

Here's what happened.

Someone posted this photo on twitter. All the sane people laughed.

@realDonaldTrump retweeted. And now it's the left's new Russian conspiracy.

I remember when all the best comedians were liberals. But the new left traded its sense of humor for baseball bats with ten penny nails.

USA!

Meanwhile, the pre-schoolers at CNN have their panties in a bunch because the President of the United States wore a hat emblazoned with USA.

Does anyone at CNN even _know_ a person who managed to reach psychological adulthood? Apparently, you're required to have a pervasive developmental disorder just to apply to the network. CNN should change its letters to IEP.
