##  . . . And [It's Deep-State Handlers](https://hennessysview.com/2017/09/19/flush-the-clapper-it-stinks/)



Jim Hoft is a genius.

From his St. Louis home, Jim runs one of the most influential websites in the universe, according to Harvard researchers. He's a legend. **Like Andrew Breitbart, Jim Hoft reshaped the media**. Hoft exposes the rotten bastards who call themselves "journalists."




** Caustic Jim Acosta
** F*** Chuck Todd
** Jake "The Fake" Tapper
** Juannabe Williams


Jim Hoft exposed these knuckle-dragging liars. These scavenger fish who cheer on Antifa's terrorism. These [thug-worshippers who hope for Kellyanne Conway's assassination](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/09/want-another-scalise-style-shooting-jim-acosta-announces-kellyanne-conway-no-longer-secret-service/).
