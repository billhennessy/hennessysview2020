_CAUTION: This report comes from very fake news blog CNN and may fall apart over the next 24 to 48 hours (like most of CNN's fake reports fall apart)._

CNN is reporting that Special Investigator Robert Mueller leaked secret documents to the press indicating the Obama White House "wiretapped" Paul Manafort before and after last year's election.

CNN previously mocked and scorned President Trump for suggesting Obama wiretapped Trump's campaign. CNN says Mueller's office cautioned that conclusions about Russian connection were "inconclusive." Meaning "non-existent."

Either Trump was right or Robert Mueller is lying to CNN. A third possibility: [CNN is full of crap](https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/18/politics/paul-manafort-government-wiretapped-fisa-russians/index.html).



> A secret order authorized by the court that handles the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) began after Manafort became the subject of an FBI investigation that began in 2014. It centered on work done by a group of Washington consulting firms for Ukraine's former ruling party, the sources told CNN.

In the meantime, add this to the longÂ list of [crazy things Trump said that turned out to be right](https://hennessysview.com/2017/03/07/many-times-trumps-crazy-statements-turned-out-to-be-right/)! (I was right, too. In March!)

UPDATE: [ZeroHedge has more](https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-09-18/government-wiretapped-manafort-2014-was-threatened-indictment-during-house-raid-repo):



> Ironically, CNN notes the "surveillance was discontinued at some point last year for lack of evidence" but was then restarted with a "new FISA warrant that extended at least into early this year"...**all of which sounds an awful lot like the Obama administration using FISA courts to spy on a political opponent.**



This story makes the MSM, late-night comedians, Robert Mueller, and Barack Obama look like iditos, criminals, or both.
