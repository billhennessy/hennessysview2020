Organizing for America is opening a new office in St. Louis this Wednesday, November 4th. I'd like to invite you to come see the new space and join us as we write letters to our representatives in Congress.  
  
With the full House and Senate set to start debating final plans for health insurance reform, we're closer than we've ever been to passing real reform. But to do so this year, we need your involvement -- building support for the President's plan, spreading the facts, and bringing new voices into this debate.
