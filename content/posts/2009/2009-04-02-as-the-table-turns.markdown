MoveOn.org is the perfect advocate for big government; neither takes  responsibility for the results of its positions.  In fact, they don't even review the results.  They merely congratulate themselves on victory and seek a new horror to reign down upon the world. 

When it comes to MoveOn's attack on President Bush, we're lucky that RedState is watching.
