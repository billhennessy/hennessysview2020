The GDP might have contracted 5.4 percent annualized in 4Q08, but the AGW industry contracted about 50 percent in one week:

 

**Hansen’s Boss**: James Hansen, AGW’s Father of Lies, received an insulting, public rebuke from his old boss at NASA. In essence, [Dr. John Theon](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2009/01/27/james-hansens-former-nasa-supervisor-declares-himself-a-skeptic-says-hansen-embarrassed-nasa-was-never-muzzled/#more-5352) of the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies, accused of Hansen of violating basic scientific principles, NASA’s scientific methodologies and policies, and of embarrassing the agency with his anti-scientific screeds on global warming. Theon’s emails portray Hansen has a fraudulent liar. (Where have you heard that before?")

 

**More Scientists Turn Skeptics**: The parade of scientists who doubt Hansen, Gore, and the whole AGW theory never ends. This week the world’s foremost authority on scientific forecasting, [Dr. J. Scott Armstrong](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2009/01/28/forecasting-guru-announces-no-scientific-basis-for-forecasting-climate/#more-5370), declared that the IPCC’s global warming documents have no basis in science and violate 72 specific principle of scientific forecasting. As the founder of the largest forecaster certification body, Armstrong effectively pronounced the IPCC invalid.

 

**Arctic Gulls in Massachusetts**: [Arctic gulls returned to Massachusetts](https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15881227/) for the first time in over 100 years, validating AGW-monger fears that climate change would alter the migratory patterns of animals. Unfortunately for the AGW people, this migration change came about because _the earth is getting cold, fast_.

 

**Gore Effect**: [Al Gore testified](https://planetgore.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NzMzMTA3M2E2MTcwZjA0MDEzZGJlODEzNzc4YjNlMjQ=) before the Senate in Washington. The weather cooperated. Snow and ice and record low temperatures blanketed the Eastern half of the United States.

 

The job of conservatism is not to attempt science, but to look for political bias in purportedly scientific claims. The AGW hysterics are based exclusively on political goals: the elimination of human freedom. Don’t let them win. 

 

Don’t be afraid to challenge your friends and co-workers to repeat the lies they hear from James Hansen and Al Gore and Michael Mann. Your friends might not have the educational advantages you’ve had—perhaps advanced degrees in prestigious universities destroyed their critical thinking skills. It’s up to us to help them.
