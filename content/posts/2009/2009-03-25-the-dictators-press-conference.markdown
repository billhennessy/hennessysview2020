I won’t write much: I’m too angry. 

 

He has not answered a single question without blaming Bush and the Republicans. He’s blamed the Republicans for the Democrat Congress! 

 

He claims that “no one disputes” his prediction of the fastest economic growth in the American' history beginning THIS YEAR! Of course no one disputes it! Rational people don’t argue with insanity.

 

Finally, he’s a Marxist bent on destroying American liberty! We don’t need to know anything else. 

 

You either love liberty or you love Obama. There’s no middle ground.

 

Stop him! Stop him, now!
