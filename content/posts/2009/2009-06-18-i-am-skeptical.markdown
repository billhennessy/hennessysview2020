You should be, too.


> The tally of continuing claims, or benefits drawn by workers for more than one week, fell 148,000 to 6,687,000, the first weekly decline since the week ended Jan. 3 and largest since Nov. 24, 2001. ([wsj.com](https://online.wsj.com/article/SB124532223513027245.html))


That would be good news, but only if a) it's true, and b) 148,000 more people found jobs than lost them last month.

Frankly, I think the government's lying to us.

Obama had been claiming he would add [600,000 new jobs ](https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSTRE5572M020090608?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews)by the end of the summer.  Conveniently, these numbers come out one week later.  Hmmm.

I'll wait to see if there's an adjustment down the road.  Obama is a statist, like Stalin and Mussolini.  I simply don't believe a word coming out of the White House.
