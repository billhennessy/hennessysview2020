More than 200 hearty patriots marched through driving snow and 20 degree temps in Kansas City today as part of the ongoing Tea Party Protest.

Congratulations to the organizers and demonstrators.  You're simple act of rebellion against Obama's socialist power-grab is a noble statement of your intent to preserve and defend our Republic.
