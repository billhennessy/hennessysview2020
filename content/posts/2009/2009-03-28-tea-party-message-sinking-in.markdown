Rasmussen's weekly report shows the Tea Party message of limited government and lower taxes is hitting home with voters.

[Tax Cuts](https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/business/taxes/more_voters_than_ever_say_tax_cuts_help_the_economy):  More voters than ever now say tax cuts help the economy.  Over 60 percent now agree with JFK, Reagan, Bush, and the undeniable facts of economic history: cutting taxes increases GDP and personal wealth.  


> A separate survey released [earlier today](https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/business/taxes/66_say_obama_likely_to_raise_taxes_on_those_earning_less_than_250_000_a_year) found that 66% of voters think the president is likely to raise taxes on those who make less than $250,000 per year. 


[Obama Approval](https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/obama_administration/daily_presidential_tracking_poll):  Obama's net favorability is down to +4 from + 30 after his inauguration.  Rasmussen notes that Obama's flurry of exposure--The Tonight Show, 60 Minutes, primetime press conference, townhall--did not increase his favorability at all.  In fact, it's fallen 2 points since last week.  

[Nationalized Banks](https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/business/general_business/just_11_say_government_can_run_financial_institutions_better):  Only 11 percent believe the government can do a better job running banks.

If these trends continue, Obama will be unable to influence key Democrats in Congress, and he will be a 3-year lame duck.  That's the best the country can hope for.

You can help by spreading the word:  Obama's plans for a socialist dictatorship are dangerous and un-American.  

Stop him!  Stop him, now!
