Also, I've started a [Facebook Group ](https://www.facebook.com/event.php?sid=8fb0dbb65c1a39772fa0c2c39dc9d35c&eid=67775481561)to keep in touch.

***We now return to our regular blogging***

**UPDATE 2:  Let's try to do this Friday, February 27, as part of a National Tea Party protest.  Already more than 15 cities involved.  Look here or on the Facebook page or follow #teaparty on Twitter for location and time. **

Thanks to Michelle Malkin for popularizing the [Tea Party Protest](https://michellemalkin.com/2009/02/21/tea-party-usa-the-movement-grows/).

Who's up for it? 

I'm thinking March 14 before the downtown St. Patrick's Day parade. 



	  * Toss some tea into the Mississippi
	  * Run 3.2 miles
	  * Freeze for an hour
	  * Drink some Jameson's and Mich Ultra

If Seattle and Chicago can find enough patriots to oppose Obama's socialization plans, St. Louis sure can.

And, Look!  Someone's written [a recipe for a Tea Party](https://theconservativerevolution.com/freedomworks/how-to-organize-your-own-tea-party-protest/).
