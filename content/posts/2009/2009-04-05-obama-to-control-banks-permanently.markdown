The Obama administration has [no intention of relinquishing dictatorial control ](https://online.wsj.com/article/SB123879833094588163.html)of the banks according to financial expert Stuart Varney. 


> The government wants to control the banks, just as it now controls GM and Chrysler, and will surely control the health industry in the not-too-distant future. Keeping them TARP-stuffed is the key to control. And for this intensely political president, mere influence is not enough. The White House wants to tell 'em what to do. Control. Direct. Command.


While naive school children and their communist professors will respond, "Oh, he's just managing a crisis caused by the last administration," any intelligent student of communist history knows that Obama is following Marxist strategy to the "T."  



	  * Create a crisis 
	  * Position yourself as savior
	  * Force surrender of power
	  * Threaten to unleash populist violence
	  * Marginalize enemies
	  * Repeat until the will of the people is broken

If you think Obama represents run-of-the-mill Democrat liberalism, think again.  Our president is as Marxist as Lenin, Castro, or Mao.  His tactics will become increasingly threatening and violent as we continue to surrender power to him. 

Last week, Obama threatened bank executives with[ mob brutality:](https://hotair.com/archives/2009/04/03/obama-threatens-bankers-im-the-only-thing-standing-between-you-and-the-pitchforks/)


> “My administration,” the president added, “is the only thing between you and the pitchforks.”…


In other words, Obama admitted that he controls the thugs and criminals who have been threatening AIG executives.  He intentionally leaked this story to us, the people, so that we know better than to resist his control.  

Too bad.  I resist his control.

Barack Obama is a Marxist thug.  He's setting up a confrontation with the American people and 230+ years of liberty. Be prepared for battle.  Don't allow this pantywaste punk to intimidate you.  It sounds like Varney has already thrown in the towel:


> After 35 years in America, I never thought I would see this. I still can't quite believe we will sit by as this crisis is used to hand control of our economy over to government. But here we are, on the brink. Clearly, I have been naive.
