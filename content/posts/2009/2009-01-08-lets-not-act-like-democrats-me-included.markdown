Request:  If you read a blog post on Hennessy's View that seems to be rooting for America to fail or suffer in order that Obama take the blame, please e-mail me (bill-at--hennessysview--dot--com) and comment.  I'm a hot-head, and I might not catch myself.

The United States and every country on earth is in a [perilous position right now](https://apnews.myway.com/article/20090107/D95IJHTO0.html).  The world economy is on the brink of depression.  Bad business practices driven by even worse government policies and regulations have destroyed $ trillions in wealth and left us on a narrow, swampy peninsula between deflation and hyperinflation.

We have, for good or ill, elected a young and inexperienced president.  That man's past rhetoric was clearly Marxist.  But his post-election appointments and words seem closer to those of George Bush than of[ Gus Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gus_Hall).  We can work to win back Congress and the White House without destroying the country in the process.

Here's a few recommendations:



	  * Praise Obama's rightward tacks more than you attack his leftist moves
	  * Look for people or businesses in your area who need help and help them if you can
	  * State the positive results of conservative governance more often than you assail the consequences of liberal error
	  * Wave to drivers of cars with Obama stickers, even as you pass them to expose your McCain-Palin tags
	  * Write letters to the editor, blog comments, and blog posts complimenting Obama's good judgment, but always identify yourself as a conservative Republican who work for his defeat in 2012

All of us are saying goodbye to co-workers let go because of the economy.  The way out of this mess is lower taxes, less government, and graceful ends for companies that can't make it.  Each of these right actions carries with it painful consequences for some of us.  We can and must make these changes to our national direction.  But we can and should make them without being asses.

We all know how painful and maddening it was to hear Democrats and liberals cheer American casualties in Iraq and fantasize about the assassination of a Republican president.  While we might not go so far, why take the chance?  Let's sell our superior system of economics and limited government.  The deficincies of their alternative will be undeniably obvious soon enough.
