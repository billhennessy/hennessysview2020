On Friday, US Premier Barack Hussein Obama tipped his hand on his plans of banning dissent. He told reporters that Republicans must “[stop listening to Rush Limbaugh](https://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2009/01/obama-takes-jab-at-rush-limbaugh.html).”

 

Were Obama an ordinary politician, we’d take this comment as a harmless, oral wish. Limbaugh is an effective advocate for conservatism, limited government, lower taxes, freedom, and peace-through-strength—all things Obama hates.

 

Obama’s not a typical politician in the American sense; [he’s a communist](https://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2009/01/rush-says-obama-is-using-marxist.html). He’s a totalitarian. 

 

During the election of 2008, Obama sent thugs to threaten, cajole, and intimidate dissidents of his campaign. They attacked radio stations in Chicago and other cities. They threatened newspapers and magazines. They prevailed.

 

For the past four years, Obama’s fellow-travelers in Congress have cried out for restoration of the Orwellian-named “Fairness Doctrine.” The Fairness Doctrine says that radio and television stations cannot air conservative commentators like Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Michael Savage, and Mark Levin if a single listener objects. In other words, the Fairness Doctrine quashes dissent.

 

When the Bolsheviks seize power in Russia, they banned private ownership of guns, private means of mass communication, and religion in that order.

 

With his telling comments to the press, we can rest assured that Obama learned well from is Soviet masters: disarm, distract, destroy.

 

Read “Homo Sovieticus” if you can find it. It’s about the future American. Also, “The Gulag Archipelago.” It’s where Rush and I will end up. 

 

Exit question: Even if he manages to silence Rush, can he [shield his ears](https://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2009/01/vatican-blasts-arrogant-obama-for.html) from the [screams of dying infants](https://michellemalkin.com/2009/01/24/it-seems-the-era-of-hope-is-to-be-inaugurated-with-a-slaughter-of-the-innocents/)?
