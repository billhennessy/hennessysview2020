The Democrat National Congressional Committee has launched an online petition calling for[ sanctamony](https://cnsnews.com/public/content/article.aspx?RsrcID=42616) directed at radio giant Rush Limbaugh.  

Why not me?  I wrote " I, for one, hope[ his presidency is a miserable failure](https://hennessysview.com/2009/01/21/obama-to-america-fk-you/) but that the country somehow survives" _before_ Limbaugh spoke similar sentiments.   I started the Campaign to Hope Obama Fails; Rush is a Johnny-come-lately.  A fair-weather fan.  He's probably a big Steeler fan all of a sudden, too.  

The next the Democrats feel the need to decry divisiveness, please send them to me.  I need the traffic.
