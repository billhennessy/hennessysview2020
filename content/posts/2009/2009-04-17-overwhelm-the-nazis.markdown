The American Nazis are holding a rally on the Arch grounds at 2:00 p.m. on Saturday, April 18.  [The Anti-Defamation League ](https://regions.adl.org/missouri/events/rally-for-respect.html)is sponsoring a counter-rally in Forest Park at the same time.

I will be at Forest Park.

So I have some strong disagreements with some of the sponsoring organizations of the counter-rally.  Big deal.  If the point of the counter-rally is to oppose Nazism, then I can easily look past those differences for a couple of hours.  We'll pick up the other fights later.
