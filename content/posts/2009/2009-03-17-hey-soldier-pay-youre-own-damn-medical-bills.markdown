That's the message from [Barack Hussein Obama](https://news.yahoo.com/s/usnw/20090316/pl_usnw/the_american_legion_strongly_opposed_to_president_s_plan_to_charge_wounded_heroes_for_treatment) to wounded veterans.




> The leader of the nation's largest veterans organization says he is "deeply disappointed and concerned" after a meeting with President Obama today to discuss a proposal to force private insurance companies to pay for the treatment of military veterans who have suffered service-connected disabilities and injuries. The Obama administration recently revealed a plan to require private insurance carriers to reimburse the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in such cases.

The White House has proposed forcing members of the Armed Forces to obtain private health insurance and to pay for treatment for injuries received in the line of duty.




Let's get this straight: the commander-in-chief will allow his all volunteer military to descend into bankruptcy due to injuries received defending his sorry ass, but he wants us to pay the bills of degenerate deadbeats.




Unbelievable. Clearly, Obama is both corrupt and incompetent. Clearly, his advisors lack the first, second, and third political instinct. Clearly, his voters are childish, selfish, ignoramuses who'd steal their mothers' social security checks.




I don't even know what to recommend. Sticking wounded warriors with the bill for their treatment is almost criminal. The Commander of the American Legion seems as angry as I am:




> The Commander, clearly angered as he emerged from the session said, "This reimbursement plan would be inconsistent with the mandate ' to care for him who shall have borne the battle' given that the United States government sent members of the armed forces into harm's way, and not private insurance companies. I say again that The American Legion does not and will not support any plan that seeks to bill a veteran for treatment of a service connected disability at the very agency that was created to treat the unique need of America's veterans!"

The American Legion should begin its protest by rescinding Obama's invitation to address their annual convention. If Obama speaks, I will cancel my membership.
