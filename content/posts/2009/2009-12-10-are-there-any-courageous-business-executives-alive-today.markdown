The most disappointing thing about leaving the military is that it usually means leaving the last bastion of leadership in America. If you open your own business or freelance, you probably don’t notice the cowardly bastards populating corner offices in most American enterprises. You’d puke, as Holden Caulfield might say.

 

**John Mackey** of **Whole Foods** had the courage to oppose socialized medicine AND to defend his position and his right to say it. Gina Loudon led a Nationwide Tea Party Coalition **BUYcott** in support of Mackey. It was a wild success. How many corporate CEOs, COOs, CMOs, CIOs, or CFOs stood behind Mackey?

 

None. Because 99 percent of business executives are myopic cowards. They would rather strap on knee pads and crawl to the White House to beg Prince Barack for scraps from Andy Stern’s bounteous plate than to stand on their own two feet and say, “You, Mr. President, are destroying the American job engine.” 

 

Maybe I’m wrong. Maybe all you enterprise executives save puppies from burning buildings in your spare time. Maybe you jump on private jets to Afghanistan and kill jihadis when you leave the office, sleeping on the flight home. Maybe you’re not self-serving cowards.

 

Prove it. 

 

**Comment on this post**. Tell St. Louis and America who you are, the company you help run, and what you’re doing to stop the socialization of America?

 

Please don’t bother if you’re going to tell me you give $2,000 to Republican candidates every year. The Republicans allowed this disaster to come about. The GOP made Barack Obama—the Democrats are too screwed up to to that. 

 

Why aren’t you in the streets? Why aren’t you funding conservative activist groups the way George Soros, Eric Schmidt, and Mark Cuban fund the commies? Why don’t you take a stand even at the expense of a few customers? Mackey did it, and we stood behind him. Where the hell are you? Why aren’t you belittling and ridiculing the White House’s anti-liberty schemes instead of licking Obama’s boots at a White House photo op?

 

Tell us here, you brave, tough leaders. Tell us. Tell us, because we’re looking for someone to rally behind. We want another Mackey to buy from. We are ready to shop YOUR STORES. We’re just looking for a few good leaders!

 

Yes, there are a few brave men and women among you. Damn few, though. Damn few. You want to know why ACORN and SEIU and all the other leftists keep shaking you down? Because you’re cowards, and you pay. No one in his right mind would buy stock in ANY company in America that’s run by a weasel who praises free markets, then bows to our socialist prince. Your profits are solely in the short term. You and your company are doomed to destruction because you are failing in your fiduciary duties.

 

Prove me wrong. Show us what you’re made of, if it’s anything but tapioca pudding. Comment. Go public. We don’t shop in shady back rooms. Man up and act like Americans. 

 

Comments section is open. Use it, ya weasels.
