Today was a particularly busy day for me.

I had a series of meetings. Like every hour, another meeting. From 9:00 on.

I saw the text from my wife. ![Screenshot 2015-07-14 18.51.07](https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screenshot-2015-07-14-18.51.07.png)


I didn't have time to click on a video. I was in a room full of people. Important business. Major client and all that. And I completely misunderstood the "H/T Gina L." thing. For some reason, I thought Angela was mad at Gina. (There's a cool psychological explanation for my misunderstanding, but that's for another post. Unless Dr. Gina wants to explain it in the comments.) Anyway, I didn't have time to deal with it. Which makes me feel like a jerk, because Angela's sick. But I am kind of a jerk.

Later, Angela texted this:

Okay. At this point I had no clue the Jindal text related to the Gina Loudon text. But I'm slow. Always have been.

By the time I got home, Angela and I had been texting about other stuff so long I'd forgotten about the Gina Loudon text. So I looked. Here's the video:

There you have it. [The organization that Hillary Clinton is proud to have funding her campaign](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/planned-parenthood-honors-secretary-state-hillary-rodham-clinton-her-commitment-womens-health-c) kills babies and sells the livers and hearts and lungs for a profit--that goes back to Hillary 2016.

[Sick](https://hotair.com/archives/2015/07/14/video-planned-parenthoods-profit-off-of-fetal-body-parts/). Evil woman. No reason to sugarcoat. Meet Dr. Deborah Nucatola.

**Raw, naked evil served straight up with fava beans and a nice Chianti. **

The modern Democratic Party and its BFFs like Planned Parenthood seem more suited for 1930s Europe than 21st Century North America.

Not just wrong--evil.

Sorry if I ruined your dinner, but this seemed important.

UPDATE: Planned Parenthood releases a statement. I agree with HotAir: [Planned Parenthood is lying](https://hotair.com/archives/2015/07/14/planned-parenthood-responds-nucatolas-just-talking-about-reimbursements/).
