A few Mizzou football players announced they're boycotting all sports activities until University of Missouri system president Tim Wolfe quits or is fired. Considering the football team's dismal performance, the cynic in me wonders if sitting out might help the players' chances of getting an NFL draft.

The players and other African-American students at Mizzou believe they are victims of "systematic oppression" and they want Tim Wolfe to fix it simply by resigning.

I cannot find any specific recommendations for Mr. Wolfe to consider other than resignation. Instead it seems he's challenged to simply "do more" without limit. Presumably, banishing all white students and professors from the University of Missouri system would not be enough.

**I suspect, however, that restoring Planned Parenthood's privileges on campus would be quell the unrest.**

In October, the University of Missouri Board of Curators held an emergency meeting to discuss personnel issues. [The four-hour meeting took place shortly after Mizzou broke ties with Planned Parenthood](https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/closed-door-meeting-triggers-questions-over-mizzou-chancellor-s-fate/article_dca5b95d-133a-5712-a2f4-99447ebf6534.html) in the aftermath of a series of damning videos that showed Planned Parenthood hawking body parts of aborted babies.

Wouldn't it be ironic if Mizzou's black athletes are being duped by the heirs of Margaret Sanger who founded Planned Parenthood, in part, to wipe the world clean of black people?

[Margaret Sanger was a strong proponent of eugenics](https://www.nyu.edu/projects/sanger/webedition/app/documents/show.php?sangerDoc=238946.xml). Via The Public Papers of Margaret Sanger at New York University, Sanger wrote in 1921:



> Today Eugenics is suggested by the most diverse minds as the most adequate and thorough avenue to the solution of racial, political and social problems. The most intransigent and daring teachers and scientists have lent their support to this great **biological interpretation of the human race**. The [first world] war has emphasized its necessity.



She was also a master manipulator who carefully said, more or less, "we must ask the inferior races to abolish themselves." But she held out the potential need for superior races to do the job. Again, from [her 1921 article on eugenics](https://www.nyu.edu/projects/sanger/webedition/app/documents/show.php?sangerDoc=238946.xml):



> Birth Control is not advanced as a panacea by which past and present evils of dysgenic breeding can be magically eliminated. Possibly **drastic and Spartan methods may be forced upon society if it continues complacently to encourage the chance and chaotic breeding that has resulted from our stupidly cruel sentimentalism**.



What is eugenics? Eugenics is a pseudoscience meant to cleanse genetic malfunction, eliminating racial, political, and social problems throughout the world. You know,[ like Hitler tried to do](https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/1796).



> In an America demographically reeling from immigration upheaval and torn by post-Reconstruction chaos, race conflict was everywhere in the early twentieth century. Elitists, utopians and so-called "progressives" fused their smoldering race fears and class bias with their desire to make a better world. They reinvented Galton's eugenics into a repressive and racist ideology. The intent: populate the earth with vastly more of their own socio-economic and biological kind--and less or none of everyone else.

But eugenics never took hold in America, right?

Wrong.



> In 1904, the Carnegie Institution established a laboratory complex at Cold Spring Harbor on Long Island that stockpiled millions of index cards on ordinary Americans, as researchers carefully plotted the removal of families, bloodlines and whole peoples. From Cold Spring Harbor, eugenics advocates agitated in the legislatures of America, as well as the nation's social service agencies and associations.

The Harriman railroad fortune paid local charities, such as the New York Bureau of Industries and Immigration, to seek out Jewish, Italian and other immigrants in New York and other crowded cities and subject them to deportation, trumped up confinement or forced sterilization.

The Rockefeller Foundation helped found the German eugenics program and even funded the program that Josef Mengele worked in before he went to Auschwitz.

But, but, but . . . but Hitler took eugenics in a direction never intended by its American sponsors, right? Surely the Yanks were talking about voluntary birth control to weed out genetic problems.

Guess again:



> Eighteen solutions were explored in a Carnegie-supported 1911 "Preliminary Report of the Committee of the Eugenic Section of the American Breeder's Association to Study and to Report on the Best Practical Means for Cutting Off the Defective Germ-Plasm in the Human Population." Point eight was euthanasia.

**The most commonly suggested method of eugenicide in America was a "lethal chamber" or public locally operated gas chambers.** In 1918, Popenoe, the Army venereal disease specialist during World War I, co-wrote the widely used textbook, _Applied Eugenics_, which argued, "From an historical point of view, the first method which presents itself is execution… Its value in keeping up the standard of the race should not be underestimated." _Applied Eugenics_ also devoted a chapter to "Lethal Selection," which operated "through the destruction of the individual by some adverse feature of the environment, such as excessive cold, or bacteria, or by bodily deficiency."

In fairness, [the final report opposed both abortion and extermination](https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/bitstream/handle/10822/556985/Bulletin10A.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y):












> Any individual once born should, in the opinion of the committee, be given every opportunity and aid for developing into a decent adulthood of maxi- mum usefulness and happiness. Preventing the procreation of defectives rather than destroying them before birth, or in infancy, or in the later periods of life, must be the aim of modern eugenics.












Still, as Margaret Sanger's own words indicate, eugenicists left the door open to more "Spartan" measures if society failed to aggressively implement its recommendations, especially segregation and forced sterilization.

While I could be wrong, I suspect that the racial unrest at Mizzou is being fomented by the Planned Parenthood brownshirts. Perhaps Mr. Wolfe's next investigation should seek to uncover manipulation of African-American students by supporters of Planned Parenthood.
