Missouri is the only state that doesn't track your medical prescriptions.

People say it like it's a bad thing.

What's wrong with the government not knowing that one bit of information about your private medical life? Can't government keep out of at least this one, extremely personal matter?

The do-gooders and busy-bodies want Missouri to maintain a database (tied into similar databases in all other states) that keeps a permanent record of every prescription a doctor or dentist writes. The state's compelling interest is . . . "we're curious."

Too bad.

Look, a big corporation makes its money running prescription databases for states. They've sold 49 licenses for their product, which means the company's growth prospects are shrinking fast. Missouri is the only hold out, so this company is lobbying hard to get Missouri to surrender.

No. We're not going to surrender.

Call your State Senator and ask him or her to filibuster this attack on privacy. Thanks to MOPP, here's what you need to know:
