### With Opportunity for All; With Favoritism Toward None



Join Us
Paddy O's--618 S. 7th Street, St. Louis, MO
4:15 PM Saturday, May 30
[RSVP on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/1404671706526502/)

They say the Export Import Bank is a tiny agency that creates jobs for small business while producing a profit for the Treasury. And rescues baby rabbits from dangerous predators. And it’s gluten free.

Call us skeptics.

We saw the news that Goldman Sachs used the Export Import Bank to secure funding for a financially unstable buyer—after paying the Secretary of State’s husband $200,000 for a fifteen-minute speech.

Crony much?

We believe in opportunity for all. And favoritism for none. Especially paid favoritism. And bought-government.

Join us at Paddy O’s before the Cardinals play (trash) the Dodgers on Saturday, May 30 at 4:15 p.m.

Hear from:




** Paul Curtman, MO Rep, dist 109
** Andrew Koenig, MO Rep, dist 99
** Jack Spooner, Activist, Attorney


**PLUS**: Heritage Action’s Ben Evans will be your gracious host and sponsor. St. Louis Tea Party’s Bill Hennessy might say something, too. (But don’t let that stop you.)

Paddy O’s is a wing of baseball heaven, steps from Busch Stadium, and the ultimate party destination before and after Cardinal games.

We will provide some awesome Paddy O’s BBQ, and you’re welcome to wash it down with Paddy O’s delicious, satisfying libations.

Here’s the easy part:
**Opportunity for All—Favoritism for None**
_A non—partisan gathering & speaking event_
Sponsored by Heritage Action for America and St. Louis Tea Party Coalition
(but mostly by Heritage Action for America)
Saturday, May 30 at 4:15 PM
Paddy O’s, 618 S. 7TH STREET SAINT LOUIS, MO 63101

**PARKING**: This is the bad part. Two hours before a Cardinal game, parking will be at a premium. The closest free parking is on Lebanon Dr. west of 7th Street. The cheapest lots, convenient to to  Paddy O's are along 7th Street south of Chouteau. Here's a map of the area:
