> People tell us who they are, but we ignore it. Because we want them to be what we want them to be.

--Mad Men



You can't make this stuff up.

Concerned Student 1950, the group that seized public ground for private use at the University of Missouri has a new concern today. It seems **the kiddos are upset that ISIS deigned to steal the headlines** by killing 120 to 150 people in Paris, wounding 200 others.

narcissism: psychology: extreme selfishness, with a grandiose view of one's own talents and a craving for admiration, as characterizing a personality type.[/caption]

As news of the horror in Paris unfolded, the narcissistic, privileged, spoiled, petulant children of Mizzou's protest movement took to Twitter to demand the spotlight return to Columbia.

Here's [the story on Right Scoop by Soopermexican](https://therightscoop.com/un-effing-believable-mizzou-protesters-are-angry-paris-terror-attacks-stole-their-media-spotlight/). Because many of the tweets have been deleted (maybe on the advice of a sympathetic Mass Media instructor at Mizzou?), here's a sample of narcissism run amok at University of Missouri:



> It's black kids trapped in their rooms at #Mizzou but y'all talking about #PrayforParis. Fuck Paris #PrayforMizzou --Sleaze Rich Porter (@Sleazemontana)







> Paris is all over my local news but I didn't see shit about the KKK threatening #Mizzou ????? --@masturbad







> I do pray for Paris, but people need to start seeing what's going on in our own country. I BARELY saw anything about #Mizzou. Quite sad --@jkleimz







> Now people are desensitizing #BlackLivesMatter and #Mizzou for what's happening in Paris, have you no common decency? --@Alasia_Justine







> Don't use the tragedy in Paris to try and undermine the awful things that are happening at #Mizzou. Both of these events are terrible. --@curvyyandcurlyy



People tell you who they are. I have no doubt **each of these people is sincere**. The kids on the quadrangle at Mizzou truly believe their plight is the equal of the victims in Paris.

**We call them "kids" for a reason. They haven't lived**. When they say stupid things, we say "that's not really who they are."

But we're wrong. They're wrong. **And some adult should say, "you are wrong, child. You are wrong."**

Now you know who **#ConcernedStudent1950 is: a spoiled, privileged, child mired in the quicksand of extreme narcissism**. With a little race hatred and fascist control-needs on top.

Hope your 15-minutes were worth it, kids. Just like [the kids at Yale](https://hennessysview.com/2015/11/09/hysterical-yale-student-embarrasses-herself-on-video/).
