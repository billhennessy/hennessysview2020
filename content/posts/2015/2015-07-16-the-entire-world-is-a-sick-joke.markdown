Greece's parliament just signed its surrender to Germany. The country signed over virtually all of its national assets and all its future income for 30 years. No one believes Greece will make good on the agreement, and Greece didn't want the deal. [Germany demanded it, and Greece surrendered](https://hennessysview.com/2015/07/15/politics-is-war-by-other-means/). But Greece will default at some point.  Then what? Will Germany send its army? Probably.

In Washington, Barack Obama berated a skeptical press for questioning the agreement he reached with the world's largest exporter of Islamic terrorism. The agreement more or less guarantees a nuclear Iran by 2025. Yet Democrats who should know better defend Obama because party comes before country. And Obama probably knows that the Iran deal means nuclear war in the Middle East in the next 10 years, but he doesn't care. Facing certain historical condemnation as a failed president, Obama is clutching at straws, hoping against hope that something works.

And [Planned Parenthood's national director of medical policy was caught on tape selling body parts of aborted babies](https://hennessysview.com/2015/07/14/not-just-wrong-evil/), a federal felony. Yet Planned Parenthood's president simply lied, saying Dr. Deborah Nucatola didn't say what we all heard her say, several times, while eating fava beans and slurping chianti.

If I were a kid observing these "grown ups" who run the world, I'd conclude that grown ups are full of crap and not worth my while listening to. In fact, I'd harbor a strong contempt for everyone over 30.

One reason [Eric Greitens looks so go to me](https://hennessysview.com/2015/07/14/eric-greitens-shocking-revelation-could-shatter-peoples-faith/) is that he's  more grown up than all the career politicians I've met combined. And the world is begging for real grown ups.
