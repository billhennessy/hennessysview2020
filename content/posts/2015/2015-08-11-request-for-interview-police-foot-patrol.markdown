If you have walked a neighborhood foot beat as a police officer, I'd like to talk to you.

I am working on a story on policing, and I would like to hear stories from men and women who have both walked neighborhoods as police officers and driven patrols in cruisers.

If interested, please contact me with this form:

I will not use your name or quotes without your permission.

Thanks,

Bill Henenssy
