Want to know why Net Neutrality is dangerous?

Forget the Constitutional stuff. That's important, but most people don't care. Seriously. As soon as you mention the Constitution or mercantilism, the 99% walk away.

And the remaining 1% already agree with you.

No, the way to scare people about Net Neutrality is this chart from Statista:

The only thing worse than Comcast's customer service? Comcast's customer service regulated by the federal government.

Net Neutrality is the happy name of a plan to make the second-worst customer service even worse.
