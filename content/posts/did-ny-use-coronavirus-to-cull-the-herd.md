It would be the most sinister murder plot in US history. Imagine a governor conspiring to thin the population of elderly people, using a pandemic as both cover and weapon. 

As unimaginable as it would be, evidence is mounting New York Governor Andrew Cuomo did just that: culled the herd in nursing homes by weaponizing Coronavirus. 

### Dumped Off With Their Own Body Bags

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo implemented an emergency declaration that required nursing homes to accept active Coronavirus patients regardless of their ability to care for or isolate the infected patients. As a result, at 12,000 people have died, and the number rises every day. 

Throughout the Coronavirus crisis in New York, the state has sent elderly Coronavirus patients to nursing homes that are ill-equipped to treat the disease or keep healthy residence safe from infection. Elderly patients who test positive for Coronavirus at hospitals are sent back to nursing homes with a supply of PPE for the staff and body bags for the patients. [From New York Post, April 23, 2020](https://nypost.com/2020/04/23/coronavirus-patients-admitted-to-queens-nursing-home-with-body-bags/):

> The first coronavirus patients admitted to a Queens nursing home under a controversial state mandate arrived along with some grim accessories — **a supply of body bags**.

Imagine your elderly grandmother being sent back to her nursing home with her own body bag in her lap. She knows she will never see her loved ones again. She's going to the home to die. 

Via [New York Post story of April 23](https://nypost.com/2020/04/23/coronavirus-patients-admitted-to-queens-nursing-home-with-body-bags/):

> An executive at the facility — **which was previously free of the deadly disease** — said the bags were in the shipment of personal protective equipment received the same day the home was forced to begin treating two people discharged from hospitals with COVID-19.
> “My colleague noticed that one of the boxes was extremely heavy. Curious as to what could possibly be making that particular box so much heavier than the rest, he opened it,” the exec told The Post Thursday.
> “The first two coronavirus patients were accompanied by five body bags.”

In the process, your grandmother will infect the people she's lived with in her final years. They, too, will soon make the grim round-trip to a hospital for testing, and back to the nursing home with their own supply of PPE and body bags. And that's exactly what happened to the first nursing home infected by Cuomo:

> Within days, three of the bags were filled with the first of 30 residents who would die there after Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s Health Department handed down its March 25 directive that bars nursing homes from refusing to admit “medically stable” coronavirus patients, the exec said.
> Like clockwork, the nursing home has received five body bags a week — every week — from city officials.
> “**Cuomo has blood on his hands. He really does**. There’s no way to sugarcoat this,” the health care executive added.

Cuomo introduced Coronavirus to an otherwise healthy nursing home. That is indisputable. The question now, is, did he do it with intent to kill? 

### Everyone Knew Nursing Homes Were Dangerous

The Coronavirus panic started when news spread of the rapid deterioration inside a Seattle-area nursing home. 

Long before the outbreak officially struck the US, we knew that the virus was particularly deadly for the elderly and those with certain chronic conditions. Cuomo called the Coronavirus situation in nursing homes "a feeding frenzy." 

Cuomo also knew that nursing homes are ill-equipped to isolate residents with infectious diseases. Nursing homes are communal living facilities where interaction with other residents is designed to provide the elderly and infirm with the socialization people need to survive. ([Social isolation will kill you faster than smoking](https://www.webmd.com/balance/news/20180504/loneliness-rivals-obesity-smoking-as-health-risk).) 

Long before Coronavirus became a panic, the White House strongly urged all nursing homes to ban visitors. 

Only a madman or an idiot, then, would send known carriers of the Coronavirus into nursing homes. But that's exactly what Cuomo did. And, when challenged on the policy that required nursing homes to accept infected patients, Cuomo doubled down. From [New York Post of April 26, 2020](https://nypost.com/2020/04/26/cuomo-doubles-down-on-sending-coronavirus-patients-to-nursing-homes/):

> The governor — who himself has described nursing homes as a “feeding frenzy’’ for the deadly coronavirus — said that the facilities can’t challenge a state regulation forcing them to admit patients with the contagion.

As a result, [half of New York's 25,000 Coronavirus deaths occurred in these facilities](https://news.wbfo.org/post/nursing-home-residents-account-almost-half-western-new-york-s-covid-19-deaths). Almost 12,000 dead thanks, in part, to a policy that assured maximum human destruction. 

Now, the question remains: did he do it on purpose?

### Means, Motive, Opportunity

When attempting to assess the probably of guilt of a suspect, police try to determine whether the person of interest met three criteria for possible guilt:

* Means
* Motive
* Opportunity

An example: if the victim was shot with a .45 caliber pistol at close range in his own home with no sign of forced entry, the police, evaluating a person of interest, would ask:

* Does this person have access to weapons? (Means)
* Does this person stand to gain from the victim's death? (Motive)
* Does this person know the victim well enough to have been invited into the home? (Opportunity)

Let's look at means, motive, and opportunity in the case of Andrew Cuomo vs. the elderly population of New York City. Assuming the crime here is mass murder of vulnerable and elderly citizens by means of a deadly infectious disease, here's how we might assess the situation:

* **Means**: The Coronavirus is particularly deadly to the very people who populate nursing homes, whether elderly or with a major chronic condition. It is also highly contagious compared to similarly dangerous microbes like H1N1 flu. We have to conclude, then, that the governor had the means to carry out this crime. The means was Coronavirus.
* **Opportunity**: The opportunity was a pandemic that gave the governor elevated, almost dictatorial power. He was well within his emergency powers to direct hospitals to return infected nursing home residents to their nursing homes and to require nursing home to accept Coronavirus patients turned away from hospitals. 
* **Motive**: What could be Cuomo's motive to kill 12,000 elderly New Yorkers? As usual, money. New York State is in dire financial straits with massive debt, declining population, and impending expenses related to unfunded retirement plans. Cuomo has begged the federal government for a financial bailout. And the elderly in nursing homes is one of the biggest budget items on New York's books. **By culling the herd of these "expenses," Cuomo stood to alleviate his state's difficult financial situation.**

As [New York State's own website admits](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/consumer/ltc/ltc_about_cost.htm):

> Downstate, nursing home costs vary from $340 per day in the Northern Metropolitan area to $390 per day in Long Island, which is approximately $124,100 per year in the Northern Metropolitan area to $142,350 per year in Long Island. It is estimated that persons in nursing homes stay for less than 2½ years on average.

Reducing that 2.5 year average stay in nursing homes would save the state a lot of money. Maybe enough to kill for?

New York City, alone, had almost 42,000 nursing home residents in 2016 (the latest year data is available.) At $124,100 per month, that's a bill of $5.2 billion a year. And that's just New York City. [This page on New York State's website](https://www.health.ny.gov/facilities/nursing/rhcf_bed_need_by_county.htm) breaks down the count of nursing home beds and expected needs for each county, a total of over 104,000 as of 2016. 

Cuomo had a very strong financial motivation to commit this crime. 

### Conclusion

Was money enough motivation to kill 12,000 people? That's impossible to know for sure. But the evidence points in that direction. 

* Cuomo knew at the time of the order that Coronavirus spreads easily and quickly. He stated so many times. 
* Cuomo knew that most hotspots began in nursing homes, where communal living and weak immune systems provided the perfect environment for rapid spread. He stated so on the record.
* Cuomo knew that his state was and remains in financial trouble, and that care of the elderly was a major drain on New York finances.

It is almost inconceivable that Cuomo simply erred in sending infected elderly patients from hospitals into nursing homes. 

Cuomo unquestionably had the means, motive, and opportunity to commit this horrific crime. But is Cuomo cold-blooded enough? 

Let's consider the fact that **Andrew Cuomo has fought for the right to kill children up to the moment of birth and even after a child is born alive**. If he's capable of murdering a baby in cold blood, he would certainly be capable of killing an old person, wouldn't he?

I suggest the Department of Justice begin collecting all communications between the New York Governor's office, the New York Mayor's office, hospital administrators, and public health organizations. This story looks like the biggest mass murder in US history. At a minimum, it was the deadliest act of negligence ever committed by a governor. Either way, this is a criminal matter, not a mere policy failure.

As that nursing home administrator told the Post: "Cuomo has blood on his hands."
