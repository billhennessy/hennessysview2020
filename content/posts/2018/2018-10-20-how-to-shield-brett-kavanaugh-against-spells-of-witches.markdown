You probably heard that [a bunch of witches are gathering in New York City ](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/13/dozens-witches-gather-place-public-hex-brett-kavanaugh/)today to put hexes on Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Donald Trump, and others. Don't take this lightly. 







Father Richard Heilman and folks at [the Holy League](https://www.romancatholicman.com/saint-patricks-lorica-protection-president-trump-2/) have asked Christians to pray the Lorica of St. Patrick for Justice Kavanaugh, substituting "Brett Kavanaugh" or "Justice Kavanaugh" for the first person pronouns.







This is a powerful prayer that's more than 1,500 years old! (St. Patrick arrived in Ireland around 432 A.D.) This prayer helped him overcome the spells of the Druids. It can certainly thwart the evil intentions of a bunch of witches in New York.
