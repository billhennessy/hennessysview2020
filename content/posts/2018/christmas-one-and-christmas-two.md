There are two Christmases: Christmas One and Christmas Two. 

Christmas One came second. Christmas Two came first. 

Christmas One is for the lazy. Christmas Two takes more work. 

Christmas One is popular. Christmas Two is unpopular. 

Christmas One is worldly. Christmas Two is other worldly.

Chritmas One works very hard to keep you from finding Christmas Two. Just as Christmas One stole Christmas Two's place of honor. 

So let's give Christmas Two some free publicity, just to make things a bit more fair. 

In a moment we'll introduct Christmas Two. First, let's look with pity on Christmas One.

### Christmas One

Christmas One is associated with increased feelings of depression and loneliness. Suicides increase around Christmas One. Christmas One makes people feel overwhelmed and underappreciated. Christmas One feels rushed and onerous and angry. Christmas One is red and green sadness that drives people to borrow and spend making their future miserable and dangerous. 

That is the story of Christmas One, and it's the only Christmas most Americans know about. 

Then there's Christmas Two.

### Christmas Two
