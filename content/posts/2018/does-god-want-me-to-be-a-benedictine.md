Discernment is a painful path.

I have been talking to the Dominicans, but God seems uninspired by that path. 

I love the Dominicans for several reasons. 

1. St. Dominic Guzman received the Holy Rosary from the Blessed Virgin, and the Rosary is my favorite way to pray.
2. I had Dominican nuns in grade school at Epiphany of Our Lord.
3. Even third-order Dominicans get to put OP (Order of Preachers) after their names, and that would rock. 

The last one, the OP, is my favorite. 

"I see you're an 'oh-pee.' What degree is that?"

"Oh, it's not a degree. It stands for 'Order or Preachers.' I'm a Dominican!"

"Uh . . . okay, then, let's move on."

When you think about it, the first two reasons are pretty good and God centered. But my main reason for wanting to be a Dominican is completely Bill focused. I wanted the title. I wanted the initials. I wanted the celebrity. 

And God has done a pretty good job of pointing out the error of my desires. 

After the local Lay Dominican leader graciously set me up for a radio interview and invited me to the local chapter's meetings three months in a row, I managed to miss all three meetings. October, November, and December. 

Like a loser. 

Or like someone who's being called in a different direction? 

### Benedictines

While all that was going on, I was bombarded with stuff about the Benedictines. 

It started with a book I bought last summer: [_Humility Rules: Saint Benedict's 12-Step Guide to Genuine Self-Esteem_](http://a.co/d/equNrzT) by a Benedictine monk stationed right here in St. Louis. I read the book on a Friday night. Couldn't put it down. I think I might have sent gift copies to a few young men I know. It was probably my favorite book of the year, and I read a lot. 

That was my first exposure, really, to the Benedictines. So I read about them online. 

They're big into prayer. And work. Their motto is "_Ora et labora_," in English "prayer and work." Sound boring, doesn't it? 

But it can't be. The author of _Humility Rules_, that book I love so much, was a professional stand-up comedian before becoming a monk. The book is funny. Very. And true. Such a true book I've never read, except for the Bible. How can a professional comedian be boring? And how could a comedian join a boring order?

He couldn't. So prayer and work must not be boring. In fact, prayer and work might be what it's all about. 

### Saint Meinrad Archabbey

My step-daughter told my wife and me about Saint Meinrad Archabbey in Indiana. A few weeks ago, Angela and I drove up there. [I loved it](https://www.hennessysview.com/posts/2018/2018-11-25-st-meinrad-archabbey-mass/). I want to go back. I feel drawn to the place. 

I don't know what I found so great about the Archabbey. But I was at peace there. 

I felt no need to speak. Truth speaks for itself. 

I felt no need to hurry. Time is only temporary. 

I felt no need to worry. God takes of it. 

I felt no need to pretend. God knows who I am. 

Our pilgrimage to Saint Meinrad was one week before my third attempt to visit the Dominicans. And unlike the previous two weeks, this time I had no excuse. I simply forgot. 

And somewhere along the line I adopted the Benedictine Cross as my personal symbol. ([See my twitter page](https://twitter.com/HennessySTL).) I don't know exactly when, but I know why. I need its power to keep me safe from temptation. (I am weak.)

### The Benedict Option

This week I started reading a book called [_The Benedict Option_, which I blogged about](https://www.hennessysview.com/posts/2018/glad-i-wont-be-around/) the other day. 

Again, Benedict. 

Inspired by this, I decided to start reading the Rule of St. Benedict, his guide for living a good Christian life. 

The very first rule convinced me that St. Benedict understood human beings quite well. Just read about these "Christian" men:

> The third kind of monks, a most detestable class, is that of the Sarabaites, who, not having been tried by rule or by experience, as gold is tried in the furnace, but, being softened like lead, by their works showing loyalty rather to the world, publicly by means of the tonsure profess their infidelity to God. These in twos or threes, or even alone without a master, shut up in the sheepfolds of their own choosing, not in those of the Lord, have as their law the gratification of their desires; since whatsoever they consider agreeable to their own will and fancy, this they call holy, and whatever is not to their choice they consider unlawful.

Ah, the typical Catholics! The God-as-Santa Catholics who believe we were put on earth for hedonistic pleasure interupted by Sunday mass with bad psuedo-pop liturgical music (which still manages to be profane.) 

So, St. Benedict had issues with the same people I have issues with. We're going to get along. 

### The Benedictine Oblates

And that brought me to the Oblates. 

Apparently, Saint Meinrad's runs the Benedictine Oblates in the USA. To be an Oblate, you have to pray the [Liturgy of the Hours](https://universalis.com/) daily, practice the [Lectio Divina](https://www.saintmeinrad.org/oblates/spirituality/lectio-divina/), receive the sacraments regularly, read the Rule of St. Benedict daily, pray for vocations to the Saint Meinrad Archabbey, and pay attention to God's presence everywhere and all the time. 

I actually do that (most days) already. Weird, right?

Then there are three promises of an Oblate: 
- Stability of Heart: being tied to one monestary for one's life
- Fidelity to the Spirit of Monastic Life: [like I wrote about in my last post](https://www.hennessysview.com/posts/2018/glad-i-wont-be-around/)
- Obedience to the Will of God: which I'm really bad at but trying and praying to improve upon

On another page, they want Oblates to visit the Archabbey as much as possible. 

I know it's 3 hours away, but I've already been there more than I've been to the Dominican meetings 30 minutes from my house. 

### The Benedict Option

I don't believe in coincidences. I didn't discover [_The Benedict Option_](https://www.hennessysview.com/posts/2018/glad-i-wont-be-around/) separate from my calling to join an order and my desire to detach from the created world to more fully attach the divine. 

It's very possible that I'm not worthy of being a Benedictine Oblate. If they're smart, they'll turn me down like a cheap blanket. 

But I'm going to try. Every time I pick up a book it seems to be a personal invitation from St. Benedict. That can't be a coincidence, can it? 

Besides, it seems St. Louis doesn't have a Benedictine Oblates chapterâ€”a modern monestary like Rod Dreher talks about in _The Benedict Option_. 

Maybe we need one.
