There is was. The Gadsden flag. "Don't Tread on Me!" The brilliant yellow symbol of the Tea Party movement flying proudly above the mobile home in which Thomas Bruce lives. 

Lived. Lived in that mobile home until the police came and took him away the day before Thanksgiving.

Thomas Bruce is charged with more than a dozen counts including murder in the first degree, sodomy, and armed criminal action. Apparently, the evidence against Bruce is convincing. 

But the crimes he's accused of seem completely out of character, according to friends and acquainenances. Bruce was a pastor at a Christian church in Cape Girardeau. Neighbors said he was friendly and funny. His most serious run-in with law enforcement was a speeding ticket. 

Until last week. 

### Disgusting Crime

Bruce is accused of forcing three women at a Catholic Supply Store to strip and perform "deviant sexual acts" on him. When one woman refused, he allegedly shot her in the head. That woman, 53-year-old Jamie Schmidt, died of that gunshot wound. 

St. Louis County Prosecutor Jim McCullough and St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar consider this one of the most disgusting crimes they've investigated. The men have over 60 years of law enforcement experience combined. 

And the accused was, until Wednesday, considered by all to be friendly, religious, and decent. 

What went wrong? 

### Father Corapi

A decade ago, my favorite Catholic preacher was Father John Corapi. 

Corapi was an ultra-orthodox Catholic priest who went to the seminary after becoming a multi-millionaire in real estate. Corapi returned to the church after his wealth led him down dark and destructive paths: cocaine, alcohol, women, Satanic drug gangs. 

Corapi, ordained by Pope Saint John Paull II, was the most gifted Catholic preacher since Fulton Sheen. His video on the Rosary was mesmerizing. Corapi's rallies became huge events, drawing audiences of 10,000 or more to arenas across the country. His weekly program became an anchor of EWTN's line-up. Corapi was the face of orthodox Catholicism. 

And then he went nuts. 

In April 2011, his religious order SOJT ordered Corapi to stop his public until it could complete an investigation into his behavior. The order had been informed that Corapi was, among other things, using heavy drugs and living with a prostitute. 

Corapi posted a bizarre video in June of that year. In the video, Corapi said he was leaving the priesthood to focus on politics. He began calling himself "Black Sheep Dog." He looked terrible. 

Corapi disappeared from the internet in 2012 and little has been seen or heard from him since. The most recent reference to Fr. Corapi I can find comes from the blog ChurchMilitant.com which provides a bit of hope that Fr. Corapi has returned to the church and to the priesthood, though not to public ministry. 

It raises the question: was Corapi a fraud or did something cause him to snap in 2010? 

### Spiritual Target on Your Back

Satan tempts the holy first. 

Jesus got baptize and retreated to the desert to fast and pray for 40 days. (Science shows that most people can go 45 days without eating any food.) Satan tempted him three times, but Jesus didn't give in. 

If God lets Satan tempt Jesus, He'll let him tempt you and me. 

Fr. Corapi warned his audience about that holiness attracts the Devil. The Devil and his demons reserve the strongest temptations for the holiest people. What better way to break the spirits of believers! For, if the holiest among us falls to temptation, what hope to the rest of us have?
