No, it's not more money. Nor better ads. Nor snarkier tweets. Nor more Facebook friends. 







Keeping the US House of Representatives out of the hands of the #AngryDemocratMob requires supernatural help. We cannot do it alone.







The other side has supernatural help. The other side cooperates with Satan for power on earth. Therefore, our battle is not with mere mortals alone, but with demons working in concert with men. Even if we were to assemble a vast army of mere mortals, we will lose. As St. Paul said:







> For though we live in the world, we are not carrying on a worldly war, for the weapons of our warfare are not worldly, but have divine power to destroy strongholds.
> 
> —2 Corintheans 10:14 RSVCE







Therefore, victory on November 6 requires that we cooperate with the divine against dark forces arrayed against us. 







Fr. Richard Heilman has a plan. First, Fr. Heilman describes the situation:







> The forces of evil know they are losing and are in full blown panic mode. Now, we see high level politicians advocating violence in order to gain power. Even witches have risen [against President Trump](https://www.romancatholicman.com/saint-patricks-lorica-protection-president-trump/), and now [against Justice Kavanough](https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2018/october/witches-launching-a-ritual-to-hex-brett-kavanaugh-still-working-to-bindtrump). Then we discovered that [evil even planted the Arch of Baal on the grounds of our Nation’s Capitol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnCGN7ZlPTM), during the Kavanugh/Ford hearings. We all know that if this pure evil regains power, we are in terrible trouble. We simply must do everything we can to “stand in the breach,” beginning with our belief in the power of prayer.

Next, he lays out the battle plan to deny the Democrats their earthly power and to push their demonic allies back through the gates of hell:







> In the lead up to the November 6 elections, we will offer two consecutive novenas, beginning on October 20. This is exactly what we did in the lead up to the 2016 election (If it aint broke, don’t fix it).
> 
> 







> The first is the Novena to St. Jude (October 20-28). The second is the one offered by the Knights of Columbus in 2016, and is offered to Mary of the Immaculate Conception (October 29 – November 6).

I write his post on Sunday, October 14. One week ago, many of you participated in the Rosary Coast-to-Coast. Spiritual warriors in 57 countries and in thousands of stations around the USA participated. We invoked the strength of God to fight the enemies of His plan. 







Now, we focus our spiritual firepower on one date: November 6, 2018. We ask for St. Michael and the Nine Choirs of Angels to assist us. We humbly acknowledge our weakness and open ourselves as vessels of the God's will.







October 20 through October 28: Pray the Novena to St. Jude







October 29 though November 6: Pray the Novena to Mary of the Immaculate Conception







During this period, make at least one sacramental confession. Attend mass each Sunday and Holy Day of Obligation. And pray the chaplet of St. Michael, a powerful prayer to enlist the aid of the Nine Choirs of Angels. 







This is a private novena series, but I would love to hear from you if you are participating. 







Fr. Heilman identifies four levels of spiritual combat for this devotion. (See [the full list here](https://www.romancatholicman.com/spiritual-warfare-campaign-in-lead-up-to-november-6-elections/).) I am committing to Level Four:





  1. Pray in a State of Grace (Go to Confession)  2. Believe God will answer our prayers  3. October 20 – October 28 – Pray the St. Jude Prayer  4. October 29 – November 6 – Pray the Immaculate Conception Prayer  5. Pray the Rosary Daily  6. Add Penance (recommend follow-through on some health challenge)  7. Pray the St. Michael Chaplet





Our 14-day fast before the August primary in Missouri yielded some fantastic results. Our friends Dottie Bailey won her primary by almost two-to-one. 







Now, the stakes are even greater. Our primary opponents were not allies of the devil. Our November 6 opponents are. 







We must defeat them. 







We cannot do it ourselves. 







We need divine weapons and a heavenly general. 







We need the archangel St. Michael. 







> St. Michael the archangel, defend us in battle. Be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the Devil. May God rebuke him, we humbly pray, and do you, O prince of the heavenly host, by the power of God thrust into hell Satan and all the evil spirits who prowl the world seeing the ruin of souls. Amen.
> 
> Prayer to St. Michael the Archangel







And, while we're at it, let us pray that the Holy Spirit turns the Democrats away from their unholy alliance with Satan and his evil spirits so that our brothers and sisters return to God and save their souls. Likewise, we pray that God keeps us free from sin and error and protects us from the near occasion of sin as we wait in joyful hope for the coming of our savior, Jesus Christ. Amen.







Please [choose your spiritual warfare level](https://www.romancatholicman.com/spiritual-warfare-campaign-in-lead-up-to-november-6-elections/) and prepare. I am weak and I fail often. I need an army of prayer warriors to keep me on the path. 







Many lives and souls depend on the outcome of the battle slated for November 6. Let us invite the Holy Trinity to wage this battle through us.
