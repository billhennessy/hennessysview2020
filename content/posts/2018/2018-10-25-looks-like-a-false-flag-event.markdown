Maybe it's a false flag. Maybe it's not. 






But it looks like a false flag.






All these mail bombs I'm talking about. 






You have to ask yourself: "who would do this two weeks before an election?"






If you're a conservative, do you do something that's bound to inspire sympathy for lefties right before an election? No.






Unless you're insane. 






Any sane person would know that a (failed) mail-bomb plot targeting a bunch of Democrats and leftists will only make conservatives look bad. 






Which is why they did it. It's psychological warfare. It's a false flag. Unless it's a crazy person. 






Who on the left would do this?






An individual or group that thinks it's smarter than most people. 






An individual or group that thinks it won't get caught until after the election.






An individual or group zealous enough to risk jail but arrogant enough to believe they'll never be caught or convicted. 






Or maybe the Deep State. 






Or maybe a conservative with serious psychological disorders. 






If I had to bet, I'd bet it's a leftie. Possibly a leftist with psychological problems. 






But we shall see. 







Update: The devices are fakes according to law enforcement. Fakes. Hoax. Democrat folly.
