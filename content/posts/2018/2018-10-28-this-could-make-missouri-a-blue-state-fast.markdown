Amendment 1 would turn over Missouri's state and federal gerrymandering to an unelected demographer. This means there's an 8 to 1 chance (87.5%) that the demographer will be a Democrat. 







Demography is a social science.  Social science majors are mostly far left or liberal. Only a handful of social science majors call themselves conservative:







> A 2015 study by psychologist José Duarte, then at Arizona State University, and his colleagues in _Behavioral and Brain Sciences_, entitled “Political Diversity Will Improve Social Psychological Science,” found that 58 to 66 percent of social scientists are liberal and only 5 to 8 percent conservative and that there are eight Democrats for every Republican.

Therefore, if you vote for Amendment 1, you're voting for an 87.% chance of Missouri being gerrymandered into a Democrat state. It makes sense to vote for the amendment if you're a Democrat. But if you're a Republican, you probably should vote No on Bad Amendment 1.
