Simple mission: poll your Missouri State Rep. If you don't know your rep, I'll give you a link a little later. But hurry. Poll closes Friday, May 18 at 6:00 p.m.







Here's the single poll question:







> 

> 
> "As your constituent, I want to know: if a vote on
impeachment of Governor Greitens were held today, would you vote Yay or Nay?"
> 
> 








Then, return to this page to record your Rep's answer.

Hennessy's View will use the results constructively. If you don't know your Missouri State Representative, [you can find them here](https://www.house.mo.gov/MemberRoster.aspx).







Thank you. Poll closes Friday, May 18 at 6:00 p.m.
