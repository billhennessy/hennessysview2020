I love listening to Gregorian Chant.

It's all beautiful. But one chant, for me, stands above the rest. I think you'll enjoy it, so I'm embedding it right here.

_Veni Creator Spiritus_ byÂ Schola Sancte Scholasticae and St. Cecilia's Abbey, UK

I hope you enjoy this lovely, calming music as much as I do. If you like it, please leave a note in the comments. Maybe even bookmark this page to listen again and again.
