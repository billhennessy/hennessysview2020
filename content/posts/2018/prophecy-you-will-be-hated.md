Matthew 10:17-22:

> Jesus said to his disciples: “Beware of men, for they will hand you over to courts and scourge you in their synagogues, and **you will be led before governors and kings for my sake** as a witness before them and the pagans. When they hand you over, do not worry about how you are to speak or what you are to say. **You will be given at that moment what you are to say**. For it will not be you who speak but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you. Brother will hand over brother to death, and the father his child; children will rise up against parents and have them put to death. **You will be hated by all because of my name**, but **whoever endures to the end will be saved**.”

I get the feeling this time is drawing near for us in America. On St. Stephen's feast day (St. Stephen was the first martyr), it seems appropriate to heed this warning and promise from Christ. 

### Breaking Down the Prophecy

Here are the elements of Jesus' prophecy:

1. Christians will be accused of crimes against the state for simply following Christ's teachings and believing that Jesus is our lord and savior.
2. When you are accused and at trial, let the Holy Spirit speak through you. You will not have to come up with some brilliant defense on your own. 
3. Anyone could betray you and cause you to be put to death, even your parents or children. 
4. You might be killed for choosing God over government, but only by choosing God can you truly be saved.

### Democrats vs. Knights of Columbus

If you pray the Liturgy of the Hours and Lectio Divino (holy reading), you, like me, are probably amazed at how timely the readings can be. Almost every day, the news of day seems tailor made for that day's Psalms, readings, and Gospel. 

In case you missed the news, Kamala Harris and other far-left Democrats in the Senate showed extreme anti-Catholic bigotry recently by asking a judicial nominee if he can be a fair and impartial judge when he belongs to the Knights of Columbus. 

As [Rod Dreher wrote](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/democrats-knights-of-columbus/comment-page-1/):

> It is hard to overemphasize how mainstream the Knights of Columbus are. Yet these Democratic senators — including Kamala Harris, who is believed to be planning a run for US president in 2020 — are demonizing the K of C for — brace yourselves — endorsing what the Catholic Church teaches. See here for all the questions asked of Buescher by Democratic senators. 

I have been warning for some time that we seem to be losing our grip in America. Every day, courts and councils, legislatures and local governments make it harder and harder to actually *live* as a Christian.

In the United States today, Christianity has replaced sex as something polite people never discuss in public, much less practice it on the street corners. 

### Jesus Warned Us

Jesus' prophecy, which came affected Christians in the first five centuries, is coming true again for Americans. 

Remember this prophecy from today's Gospel:

> you will be led before governors and kings for my sake as a witness before them and the pagans

I realize that the Senate Democrats have not quite reached Diocletian levels of persecution yet. But it's important to look at trends. And trends, unless reversed soon, could lead quickly to mass persecution of Christians in many states. We're already seeing this happen as bakers and even song writers are threatened with bankruptcy and prison for following Christ's teaching on sexuality. 

In other words, in many states, it is a crime to be a Christian already. It is a crime to *practice* your faith. Kamala Harris doesn't care what you believe, only how you behave. She wants you to worship pagan gods in public and keep your Christianity to yourself. 

As I have said before, I'm not sure Americans have the will to reverse these trends. 

### Jesus Promised Us

The good news, of course, comes from the same passage from Matthew: 

> whoever endures to the end will be saved

Eventually, the Democrats will take over the Senate. When that happens, belonging to a Christian church or organization will probably disqualify anyone from an office requiring Senate confirmation. 

The effects of this prohibition will take years to play out, but you can easily see what the future holds. At some point, the vast majority of judges and justices will be people who either openly hostile towards Christianity or so intimidated by the culture that they refuse to defend Christ. 

At that point, no matter what the statues say, case law will eventually make Christianity a secular sin. Employers will screen out Christians for fear of government sanctions and public boycotts. 

At that point, we will have little to cling to. Except the words of Christ quoted above. 

And that's quite a promise: you will be saved.
