I've been using Google Adsense for years to offset the cost of hosting this site.

Google never paid enough to cover the costs, but the ad revenue helped.

The thing is, Google is an evil company run by evil men. I don't want to support evil people, so I've eliminated my Google ads. (Google is very unfair to publishers, by the way. They rig their system so you don't get paid.)

I might incorporate some better advertising in the future. Or put up and old-fashioned blog tip jar like it's 2003. Until then, enjoy the ad-free content.
