And by "fest" I mean "fundraiser." Or just fun. 







For Dottie Bailey, soon to be the new Missouri House Rep from 110th District of Wildwood, Eureka, and Pacific.

Come out and join us! This will be fun. Great chance to meet Dottie and talk to old political friends about the upcoming election. Much to discuss!
