I predicted that Judge Brett Kavanaugh would be rejected by the Senate. I was wrong. In a few minutes from the time I write, the Senate will confirm Judge Kavanaugh by a vote of 50 ayes to 48 nays. One Republican will vote "present."







What went wrong? 







I underestimated the courage and fortitude of three Senators: Republicans Jeff Flake and Susan Collins, and Democrat "Lonely" Joe Manchin. 







I truly believed Flake would put his hatred of Donald Trump before the good of the country and vote nay. I believed Susan Collins would vote nay for purely ideological reasons. And I suspected Joe Manchin will cave to pressure from his fellow Democrats.







I was wrong.







I owe all three Senators high marks and sincere apologies. They will be forever targets of the vile, disgusting left. Flake, Collins, and Manchin will be harassed and threatened for the rest of their lives. 







On this vote, Flake, Collins, and Manchin put it all on the line. Rarely have we seen such courage from career politicians. And **never have I been happier to be wrong. **







Going further, Senator Collins explained her aye vote with one of the greatest speeches ever delivered on the floor of the Senate. She elevated entire US Senate with her words explaining why she was compelled to vote for Judge Kavanaugh's elevation. We all know that Susan Collins loathes president Trump. Her vote for his candidate can only be described as noble.







I also owe thanks and apologies to Senator Chuck Grassley and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Like the 1999 Rams' defense, they bent but never broke. When the game was on the line, they made The Tackle. To my shock, they displayed the highest principles of leadership and guts. 







Congratulations, President Trump and Justice Kavanaugh for your fortitude and resilience. So many past presidents and nominees caved under less pressure. 







But the lion's share of congratulations goes to Senators Flake, Collins, and Manchin. You deserve a place in the next edition of Profiles in Courage.
