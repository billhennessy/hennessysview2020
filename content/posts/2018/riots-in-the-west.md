They were warned. They didn’t listen. 

The Western World is burning because the elitists, especially in Europe and North America, stole the wealth and power of the non-elites.  

Let’s call the non-elites “Yellow Vests.”

### The Yellow Vests Are Uncovering Secrets

What's prompting the large-scale riots that threaten to destabilize or overthrow governments in France, Belgium, and elsewhere? 

Two "secrets" of the post-war West:

1. Following World War II, the elites of academia, government, and industry (including labor) rigged the system to give themselves all the real control of events. 
2. The elites required total submission from the Yellow Vests.

What's happening now is simple: the Yellow Vests are withdrawing their submission, declaring their independence, or, at least, declaring their submission to something else. 

### Everyone's a Slave to Something

I wrote in a blog post last August: 

> Everyone is a slave to someone or something.

> And you could do a lot worse in the lord and master department than Jesus Christ. For example, you could be a slave to sin. Or a slave to work. A slave to fashion. A slave to money. A slave to a politician or political party or ideology.



I started writing this blog a couple nights ago. Friday, I think. But I just deleted all the words I wrote then. They weren't necessary. They were overcome by events. 

The events, or event, that overcame them: I found the book. THE book. The book with the message that I've been clumsily sending since about May or June. The message is the title of this blog:

### Politics will not save us.

The book is _The Benedict Option_ by Rod Dreher. The message is the same: politics can't save us. 

In _The Benedict Option_, Dreher calls on orthodox Christians to return to monasticism. Because Dreher thinks Western civilization is collapsing the way the Roman Empire did in the 4th and 5th centuries. 

I agree. I think you're probably delusional if you don't agree. As [I wrote way back on August 10][1]:

> For the time being, President Trump holds our torturers and persecutors at bay. But Trump won’t be president forever. He could be out of office a year from now should the Democrats take over the House and Senate in January.  And, if Trump is impeached and convicted, the future President Pence has little chance of winning in 2020.

> We could then fight a bloody civil war. It would be a low-level war fought in small skirmishes. A guerilla war that lasts for decades.

> As that war wears on, America’s economy would falter. Our ability to maintain a defense would languish. We would be at the mercy of foreign powers like China, Russia, and even Iran. Even if the forces on the right prevailed in the civil war, the victory would be pyrrhic. The America we’d inherit would scarcely resemble the America of our birth or even of America’s birth.

I was right, but I was too optimistic. The economy is already faltering. The Trump boom is being assassinated by his enemies in finance, banking, business, and, especially, the government. As [The Gateway Pundit noticed tonight][2], the Department of Justice intentionally undermined President Trump's meetin with Chi-com leader Xi by arresting one of Xi's allies without even advising the president. That's how the Deep State works. It's above the law. 

Frankly, there is no law in America except the law of the jungle. And the law of prayer. 

### Modern Monasticism
