"I will fully cooperate with the FBI."

You hear it all the time. Whenever anyone, guilty or innocent, is accused of a federal crime, they immediately rush to the nearest press conference to announce their full coopoeration with the FBI.

Stupid move. 

The FBI has carte blanche power to prosecute anyone for "lying." And the FBI's definition is lying is a little broader than the general population. Plus, the lie isn't limited to statement under oath. In fact, you don't even to know that you're talking to an FBI agent. The FBI can prosecute you for any falsehood regardless of whether your falsehood releates in any way to a crime. 

Think about that. Any factual error you make can be prosecuted if an FBI agent happens to notice. How many times have you accidentally left out a "not" or "no" when writing, completely reversing the meaning of your statement. Example:

"I had no physical contact with that intern" becomes "I had physical contact with that intern." Supppose the first statement was true and provably true. But your mind moved faster than your fingers and you didn't type the word "no." Readers know I do this all the time. I skip words. I can't type as fast as my mind can write. So my fingers jump ahead and skip words. Sometimes they skip important words like "no" and "never." Sometimes they only skip a few characters, like "n't." That changes "didn't" to "did." 

All those typos are federal crimes. Like the one General Mike Flynn was charged with. Felonies typos. 

What's worse is that the FBI likes to use this awful power to set what they call "perjury traps." A perjury trap is pretty simple to set, really. You just ask someone a bunch of questions. If they make a mistake, you charge them with lying to the FBI. It's a scam, but it's a very serious scam from which people have no recourse. If the FBI decides to ruin your life with a perjury trap, consider your life ruined. There's nothing you can do. No one can help you except the POTUS with a pardon. 

Because of the power of the perjury trap, cooperating with the FBI is a fool's game. Dont' do it. Never cooperate with the FBI.
