Scott Adams predicts Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed. 







I don't. 







I predict his nomination won't get out of committee. 







Jeff Flake of the judiciary committee will vote no. 







Trump will have to nominate someone else. 







He'll nominate Amy Coney Barrett. 







There will be no hearing for Judge Amy. 







Diane Feinstein will have no opportunity to spew her [anti-Catholic bigotry.](https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/07/amy-coney-barretts-cult/)







She will pass the committee about 72 hours after the Senate receives the nomination. 







The full Senate will vote about 48 hours after the committee. 







And no nominee to a federal court will ever get a hearing again. 







But I could be wrong.
