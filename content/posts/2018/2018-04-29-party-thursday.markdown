A great State Rep decides to give up his seat. The seat previously held by the Speaker of the House and a conservative legend. A seat in, perhaps, the most reliably **conservative** House district in St. Louis County.







Now, there's a battle for that seat. A battle between a left-leaning Establishment Republican and a **grassroots** **Conservative** activist. An activist whose work for the right causes earned a star on **Heritage Action's Wall of Honor.**







Political intrigue, Missouri style.







And here's your chance to witness the epic battle from Day One!







Meet the upstart** grassroots Conservative activist, Dottie Bailey,** when former Speaker of the Missouri House, **Tim Jones**, hosts a Meet-the-Candidate fundraiser at Tim Jones's Leadership for America office, **[137c South Central Eureka MO 63025](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=137c+South+Central+Eureka+MO+63025&t=canonical&ia=maps&iaxm=maps)** (Pub next door for overflow, because this is going to be like a Trump rally!) 6:00 to 9:00 p.m.







This is **THE Tea Party event of the 2018 election cycle**. Do not miss it!







Please RSVP on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/199456934172804/). But, if you forget to RSVP, show up Thursday, anyway. We'll make room for you! And bring two friends. They'll thank you later.
