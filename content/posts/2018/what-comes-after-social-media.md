You get the feeling that the Age of Social Media is ending, don't you?

In my lifetime, we've seen several "ages" driven by technology, media, and culture. Those ages were:

- The Age of the Phonograph. In the 1960s, everyone from teens to aging moms and dads would hold parties centered around records. Portable record players were the rage. My mom and dad had a Select-o-Matic 500 juke box in their basement. But that era ended in about 1972. 
- The Age of Television. In the mid 1970s, television took the place of the phonograph, and Monday Night Football led the way. The same people who would invite friends over to listen to records in the 1960s were, in the 70s, inviting their friends over on Monday nights to watch football. 
- The Age of Computers. The computer age began with Apple's 1984 Super Bowl commercial introducing the Macintosh.  It lasted until Facebook reached 1 billion users, ushering in . . .
- The Age of Social Media

But now the social media age seems to be ending. I could be wrong, but I'll bet people spend far fewer hours on staring at these time-sinks as 2019 rolls on.

- Facebook is flailing, and its management is under a bi-partisan government microscope
- Twitter still hasn't reached escape velocity
- Snapchat rose and fell
- New social media platforms are flavors of the week, quickly appearing and disappearing as users demand ever more stimulation to satisfy their addictions
- People want to be left alone

For the sake of convenience and simplicity, let's just go with my premise: **the age of social media is ending**. 

So, what comes next?

### Let Us Be Banned

Before we look at what might follow social media, let's accept that being banned from Facebook or Twitter is not a death sentence. Even if you're a social media star. 

Facebook recently banned Franklin Graham for, of all things, expressing accepted Christian and scientific understanding on sex assignment. Namely, one's sex is assigned by God (Christian truth) and indelibly imprinted in one's DNA (science fact). Apparently, merely stating this undeniable truths and facts is enough to get a man as good as Reverend Graham booted from Facebook. 

Instead of wringing our hands, we should probably celebrate. Celebrate the knowledge that Facebook's owners don't want us on their forum.  

As Christians, we are called to evangelize, and social media seems to make evangelization easy. But we have an even higher calling.

On the other hand, we're called to be *in* the world but not *of* the world. If our happiness depends on acceptance by Facebook strangers, we have lost our Christian mooring and are seeking the world's approval first. 

So let's not get upset by Facebook and Twitter bans. Facebook and Twitter are fading. Even advertisers are beginning to realize those media are less effective than once thought.
