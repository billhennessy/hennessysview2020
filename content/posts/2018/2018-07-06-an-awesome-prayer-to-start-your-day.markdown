You will find yourself saying this out loud as if it we're a great soliloquy. This prayer is pure strength.

## Lorica (Breastplate) of St. Patrick

I bind to myself today 
the strong virtue of an Invocation
 of the Trinity: 
I believe the Trinity in the Unity 
the Creator of the Universe. 

I bind to myself today 
the virtue of the Incarnation of
 Christ with His Baptism, 
the virtue of His crucifixion 
with His burial, 
the virtue of His Resurrection 
with His Ascension, 
the virtue of His coming on
the Judgement Day. 

I bind to myself today 
the virtue of the love of seraphim, 
in the obedience of angels, 
in the hope of resurrection unto reward, 
in prayers of Patriarchs, 
in predictions of Prophets, 
in preaching of Apostles, 
in faith of Confessors, 
in purity of holy Virgins, 
in deeds of righteous men. 

I bind to myself today 
the power of Heaven, 
the light of the sun, 
the brightness of the moon, 
the splendour of fire, 
the flashing of lightning, 
the swiftness of wind, 
the depth of sea, 
the stability of earth, 
the compactness of rocks. 

I bind to myself today 
God’s Power to guide me, 
God’s Might to uphold me, 
God’s Wisdom to teach me, 
God’s Eye to watch over me, 
God’s Ear to hear me, 
God’s Word to give me speech, 
God’s Hand to guide me, 
God’s Way to lie before me, 
God’s Shield to shelter me, 
God’s Host to secure me, 
against the snares of demons, 
against the seductions of vices, 
against the lusts of nature, 
against everyone who intends
 injury to me,
 whether far or near,
 whether few or many. 

I invoke today all these virtues 
against every hostile merciless power
that may assail my body and my soul: 
against the incantations of false prophets, 
against the black laws of heathenism, 
against the false laws of heresy, 
against the deceits of idolatry, 
against the spells of witches, and smiths, and druids, 
against every knowledge that binds the soul of man. 

Christ, protect me today
 against every poison,
 against burning,
 against drowning,
 against mortal wounding, 
that I may receive abundant reward. 

Christ with me, Christ before me, 
Christ behind me, Christ within me, 
Christ beneath me, Christ above me, 
Christ at my right, Christ at my left, 
Christ in the fort, 
Christ in the chariot seat, 
Christ in the ship, 
Christ in the heart of everyone who thinks of me, 
Christ in the mouth of everyone who speaks to me, 
Christ in every eye that sees me, 
Christ in every ear that hears me. 

I bind to myself today the strong virtue of an invocation of the Trinity. I believe the Trinity in the Unity, the Creator of the Universe. 

Amen.
