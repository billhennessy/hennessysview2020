I watched the CBS Evening News tonight, so I couldn't see the competition.  NBC and ABC were unable to find a single forensic document specialist who believe the documents on CBS News were legitimate.  These included former FBI document experts now teaching forensics at universities.   
  
Apparently, the only expert who thinks Jerry Killian typed and signed the CBS papers is the CBS employee featured on their broadcast tonight.    
  
Funny--the liberal press isn't rallying to CBS's side.  MSNBC in particular seems to be leaning toward pronouncing the documents frauds.    
  
Me, too.![](https://blog.billhennessy.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=577)
