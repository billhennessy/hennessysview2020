Time Magazine's Man of the Year title often makes a mockery of the honor. Remember the PC?




This year, though, Time's editors got it right. Tempted, no doubt, to embarrass their political enemy, the editors took the high road by selecting George W. Bush, the most remarkable President in half a century, as its Man of the Year, 2004.

Every conservtive or Republican over 35 hails Ronald Reagan as the greatest President since Roosevelt. I agree. But George W. Bush's mark will be a deeper one. It will define the president for the next 50 years, the way Roosevelt did from the Depression to the end of the Cold War. 




While Reagan displaced Roosevelt's reign as the image of a president, Reagan's era was a short one. W has eclipsed Reagan already, and he's only half way done.
