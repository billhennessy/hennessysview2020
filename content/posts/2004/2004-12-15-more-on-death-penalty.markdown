Yesterday, I linked to a story about the decline in death sentences in the US. That reminded me of a post from last June about[ David Berkowitz](https://forgivenforlife.com/journal.html). Then I found [Annie's piece on After Abortion](https://afterabortion.blogspot.com/2004/12/pro-life-but-nothing-scott-peterson.html).




I still haven't reached a new decision on the death penalty. I'm in a no-man's land where I want the death penalty to be available to juries, but I don't that I could ever condemn a stranger. I could kill someone who needed to be killed for the safety and welfare of myself or society or family. But I would have a very hard time voting to kill someone.




Anyway, I enjoy reading Berkowitz's journal. The entries are very Christian, so, if that offends, read them all. I'd love to read other's reactions to these stories. Let me know if anyone else has posted about the death penalty lately.
