Yesterday (July 8), Tom Ridge called a press conference to inform the public that intelligence now exists strongly suggesting that Al Queda will launch a major terrorism act inside the United States in an attempt to "disrupt" (read, "help the Democrats win") the November elections.




Almost immediately, evil bastards in the DNC and their minions in the press began a whipering campaign that Ridge was making up these reports in order draw attention away from John Kerry's campaign. 




Only the criminal minds of ruthless people could fashion such underhanded motivations in others. These whisperers and the press who report their falsehoods are people who would, without a second thought, make up such lies for their own political benefit. There is good reason for men and women of good will to seek to destroy the Democrat party: the reason is the Democrat party.
