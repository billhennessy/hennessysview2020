Yesterday, [Dan Rather wrote ](https://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/08/29/opinion/main639222.shtml)on his blog that Democrats are becoming frustrated and disappointed with the Kerry campaign. As I noted earlier, there's a feeling of a big Bush surge coming.




Now, Al Hunt, in today's Wall Street Journal, writes of a "major shake-up" coming in the Kerry campaign. (Remember all of Al Gore's shake-ups? Remember the contrast between Bush's well-oiled machine with one man making quick decisions against Gore's committee-driven, poll watching, risk averse blob?)

As a result, the message often is muddled and the reaction to hard-hitting attacks from Republicans often is slow and unconvincing.

In June 1992, Bill Clinton's campaign was cratering; he was running third in the polls, behind President Bush and Independent candidate Ross Perot, the message was muddled, high-level conference calls involved dozens of campaign chiefs as there were no clear lines of authority. Hillary Clinton stepped in, tapped James Carville to be in charge of everyone, and Mr. Clinton went on to win in November.

I would disagree with Hunt's comparison to Clinton's campaign. Clinton was in trouble much earlier. By the GOP convention, Bush 41 looked ready to go. "Read my lips," was still playing everywhere. The Kerry campaign looks much more like Gore's in 2000 from my view.
