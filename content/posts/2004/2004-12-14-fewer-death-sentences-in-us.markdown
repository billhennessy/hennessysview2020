[American juries are awarding the death penalty](https://apnews.myway.com/article/20041214/D86V3OD01.html) with decreasing frequency these days. Good news.




I have vacillated on the death penalty for several years, beginning with witnessing the implosion of the old St. Louis Arena. (Long story.) But let's give credit where it's due: the death penalty itself.




Never having been a proponent of the deterrent of the death penalty, I have maintained that capital punishment can be defended on two grounds:




1. Some crimes deserve elimination of the perpetrator.




2. Society must, occasionally, demonstrate its abhorrence with an individual by his execution.




I think one of the reasons the death penalty is in decline is because we have already killed a lot of the individuals who fit category 2. Additionally, the correlation between our large prison population and our 50-year low crime rates is too obvious to miss, except for liberals, who believe that crime is low because of global warming. 




UPDATE: I found[ this interesting piece ](https://afterabortion.blogspot.com/2004/12/pro-life-but-nothing-scott-peterson.html)from Annie on AA.
