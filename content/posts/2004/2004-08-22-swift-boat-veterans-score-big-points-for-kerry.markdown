The swift boat veterans who penned  the anti-Kerry book  have accomplished two things:  made themselves look petty and made John Kerry look strong.  
  
Hey, amateur politicians:  Never give your opponent the opportunity to take a stand in defense of himself, his family, or his military service.    
  
Kerry got no bounce from the DNC convention, but he will get 10 points from the swiftvets by this time next week.  Bush will be down 12 when the GOP convention begins thanks to amateur political hacks who thought they could help their candidate. Any criminal defense lawyer will tell you that the most dangerous witness to the accused is his best friend.
