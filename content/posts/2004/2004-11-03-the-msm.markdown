The networks and newspapers are not calling states they know Bush has won in order to not force Kerry to concede. [As Jay Cost points out](https://jaycost.blogspot.com/2004/11/this-is-disgusting.html), this is disgraceful. 




I will call it. Bush has now won Nevada, New Mexico, Iowa, and Ohio. He has won the popular vote. George W. Bush has been re-elected to a second term as President of the United States by the will of its free citizens.




May God have mercy on the Democrat party.
