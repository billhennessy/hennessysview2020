Deaniacs send money to the Dean campaign whenever there's a negative story about their candidate. (The fact that this method raised $15 million in three months says something about Dean, but I'm not sure what.) I propose that readers donate $5.00 to this blog every time Dr. Dean says something stupid. The money will be used to improve the site, allow me more time to research and write, and, if Dean remains on the front pages until November, let me retire a wealthy man this time next year.
