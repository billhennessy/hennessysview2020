Slate, quickly becoming the prickliest liberal thorn in Howard Dean's side, has an excellent commentary, today, by [Mickey Kaus](https://www.slate.com/id/2093295/)




I would add my own rebuttal to Dean's comments, but between Kaus's analysis and Dean's own political stupidity and pathological carelessness, I really can't make this any more damaging to the good doctor's faultering reputation.
