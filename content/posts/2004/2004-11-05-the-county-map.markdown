Liberals (and you should check out CaptainNormal.com, democraticunderground.com, or Jane Smiley's vituperations in Slate.com) want us to believe that a few ignorant, hate-filled yahoos in a handful of places like Macon, Georgia and Waco, Texas gave this election to President Bush. They think they, not the 58 million who voted for Bush, are the majority.




USA Today has given us a county-by-county map of the election. If I were a Blue American, I'd be worried.
