No, it's not about football.

1. Howard Dean isn't an idiot, according to [Andrew S](https://www.andrewsullivan.com)ullivan. He's a doctor, dictator, refuses to be challenged or questioned, has no peers, likes to tell people what to do, right or wrong, and let the patient suffer the consequences of his errors.

2. PoliBlog.com has an interesting piece on [Dean and Job](https://www.poliblogger.com).

3. Don't miss[ The Corner ](https://www.nationalreview.com/thecorner/corner.asp)today.

4. I will have more to write later.
