Turns out the President was a pretty good pilot, particularly in the classroom. This is from MSNBC:

The new records are consistent with the President's long-standing assertion that he trained regularly until 1972 when transfered to Alabama to work on a Senate campaign. If Michael Moore cared about accuracy, he'd have to swallow some crow.




Then again, Michael Moore, I'm sure, would be more than happy to swallow crow, pheasant, albatross, or anything else that once flew.
