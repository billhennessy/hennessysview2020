Yeah, we were all on pins and needles, weren't we?  Speaking in San Francisco, CA, the New York Senator affirmed the most basic belief of liberalism:  educated elites know better what's good for you than you do, and they will use the full power of the US government to force you to comply with their plans.  
  
"We're going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good," she said.    
  
I am one of the people she will take things away from.  By proxy, she will deprive things of my wife and my children.  My children have, in recent years, become familiar with disappointment and doing without.  They don't play sports because I can't afford the fees.  They don't go on neat, kids vacations.  They live in a nice house in a nice subdivision with excellent schools, because those things, to me, are important.  Because I was a single father with sole physical custody, I passed up career opportunities that could have earned me a lot more money.   
  
By many standards, I am wealthy.  Poor people, even people like the family I grew up in, don't live in my subdivision unless they lucked into a house.  The property taxes alone are daunting.   Neither, though, do I live exceedingly well.  I have one car that provides utility.  My wife has one, as well, since we both must work to stay in our house.    
  
Our tax cuts last year helped a lot.  If the Democrats revoke those cuts, I will probably have to move my children to worse neighborhood with worse schools.  Should anyone care but me?  No.  But when a millionaire Democrat tells me she's going to steal my money for "the common good," I can respond only in the words Dick Cheney gave us:  Fuck Off.![](https://blog.billhennessy.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=731)
