[RatherBiased.com ](https://ratherbiased.com/news/content/view/520/2/)is reporting that the senior management as CBS wants to supress the most damaging parts of the "independent" investigation into Dan Rather's use of forged, electronically invented documents to help John Kerry's campaign.




The report was promised on Tuesday of this week, then on Wednesday. Now, insiders say maybe January. My bet would be -- never.




While MoveOn.org thinks it has bought and paid for the DNC, they it will soon learn, as William F. Buckley did in the 1970s, that buying CBS is very expensive proposition. And if you don't own the big three networks, you don't own the DNC.
