250 private citizens -- Vietnam veterans all -- attacked John Kerry's previously unscrutinized service record. It made news because Kerry is running for president.

CBS News and the Democrat National Party, now, are re-examining Bush's National Guard service and spewing lies that were already answered and resolved in 2000.

I honestly do not remember a presidential campaign in which the media so forcefully and openly worked to elect one candidate over another. I think it's time to break up journalism in America. It no longer serves the purpose intended by the Founders.
