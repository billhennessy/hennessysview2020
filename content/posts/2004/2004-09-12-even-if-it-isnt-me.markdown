Can I be happy day and night,  
Whistle Disney tunes and bright  
Exciting airs delight,  
Even if it isnt me?  
Never, ever curse or scowl,  
Seldom frown or whimper foul,  
Never drag a drooping jowl,  
Even if it isnt me?  
My moods Ill keep so high  
And sunny.  Jokes to slap your thigh,  
So funny. Absolutely nothing dry,  
Even if it isnt me?  
So many faults in me youve found  
That I dare not make the slightest sound  
Or wear a nasty, ugly frown.  
Even if it isnt me.  
Im allows pissed and without cause,  
Im the monster giving pause  
To everyonethe kids, in-laws.  
Even if it isnt me.  
I still scribble, in meetings boring,  
Your sweet name with arrows soaring  
Toward my waiting heart-adoring.  
Even if it isnt me.  
I know theres someone just for you, dear,  
Someone kind, in perfect cheer  
You long to love and so revere,  
Even if it isnt me.
