Just took a quick trip through DemocraticUnderground. Hehehehehe. Oh, there's such joy in Mudville. 




My favorite posts, summarized:





  * Everyone who voted for Bush is a toothless, SUV-driving, NASCAR-watching, illiterate who doesn't deserve to vote
  * America will become a 3rd world country
  * Calling for boycotts of all American products by both Americans and everyone else in the world
  * Begging Canada to annex the blue states. (I'm not sure I'd stand in the way)
  * Virtually hugs to liberals in red states who have to live amongst brain-dead idiots
  * Hopes that radical Islamists will kill all American soldiers in the Middle East


Folks, these are the sentiments of the people we just defeated. Thank God.
