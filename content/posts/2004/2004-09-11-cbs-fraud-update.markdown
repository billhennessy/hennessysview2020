I've been busy cleaning the house (Saturday is Field Day around the Hennessy house), but I have had time to look around and find:





  * A retired Major General whom CBS News claimed corroborated the Killian memos says that CBS lied to him. According to ABC News, Maj. Gen Hodges, Killian's supervisor at the time the memos were supposedly written, says that CBS told him that all of the memos were "hand written," not typed. The General says after seeing the documents, he now believes they are frauds. [More . . .](https://abcnews.go.com/sections/politics/NotedNow/Noted_Now.html)
  * The person whom the 1973 Killian memo claims was pressuring him to "sugarcoat" Bush's Fitness Report had been discharged a year before that memo was written. Obviously, that memo was a fraud. [More . . .](https://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationalpolitics/2002032742_bushguard11.html)
  * A CBS producer is rumored to have told friends that the memos "were too hot not to air," admitting that any questions of authenticity were intentionally ignored. Dan Rather, apparently, was hellbent on airing these memos and didn't care if they were DNC plants. 
  * CBS admits that it does not now and never did have the original memos--only copies.
  * [From National Review Online](https://www.nationalreview.com/kerry/kerry200409111432.asp):   
The only expert cited by CBS in this case, **Marcel Matley**, wrote in the September 27, 2002 issue of [the journal](https://d2d.ali-aba.org/_files/thumbs/components/PLIT0209-MATLEY_thumb.pdf), "The Practical Litigator":

    * **"In fact, modern copiers and computer printers are so good that they permit easy fabrication of quality forgeries. From a copy, the document examiner cannot authenticate the unseen original but may well be able to determine that the unseen original is false. _Further, a definite finding of authenticity for a signature is not possible from a photocopy_, while a definite finding of falsity is possible."**
  * Dan Rather has gone on a book-tour style marketing campaign, attempting to deflect attention from the legitimacy of the documents. 


Dan Rather has used the term "preponderance of evidence" nine times in the past two days. By that standard, he and his handlers in the Kerry Campaign or DNC are guilty.
