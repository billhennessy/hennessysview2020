In today's New York Times, Maureen Dowd--as rotten a human being as she is a writer--rips George Bush for writing "Let Freedom Reign," instead of "ring" on a note announcing the control of Iraq had been passed to Iraqi's governing council.  
  
Maureen Dowd must be a joy.  I hope I never meet her.  Virtually the whole her being now works toward displaying her visceral hatred for George Bush and for anyone who would vote for him.  She snipes, bitches, rants, spits, and hisses her vituperations from the pulpit of the most corrupt, unethical, and unreliable newspaper in a major market.  Does her psychologist read these things?  If so, why isn't she getting more aggressive treatment.  
  
I take solace in the fact that fifty years hence, authors and historians will continue to write books about the President who fought the terror wars even after Maureen Dowd's bitter, angry existence has reached some anonymous end.![](https://blog.billhennessy.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=721)
