The Democrats have a real dilemma: Dean is seen by more and more people as both a shameless opportunist and a man who can't speak straight. Making mistakes of fact at a pace of three a week, he runs the risk of looking significantly less intellectually vigorous than President Bush--something most people thought unthinkable a few months ago. Is it any wonder that Kerry, Gephardt, and the rest of the Democrat field are scared of Dean? And should we all be?
