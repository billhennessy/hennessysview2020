I turned my back to the darker world many years ago. 




I trained my focus on lighter things and happier sounds.




I let myself laugh at things that I wouldnt have before.




I let myself cry when babies laughed or someone, with




Just the right inflection and sincerity, said, God Bless




America or Look at that rainbowthere.







But the darkness didnt turn its back on me, for sure.




Hes kept me in his gaze like a lions on a gazelle.




However faster I laughed or cried, he slithered 




All the faster. Patience. Waiting outs his game.




Look how easily you laugh, Amy said at Uncle Bills.




And still, behind me, sat the darker world eating pancakes.







The darker world has overtaken my decelerating stride.




Hes before me now, and, though I turn, he scampers




Back to face me head-on. I turn in circles, avoiding him.




A duller mind would think that darkness lay all around.




I dont. I know its only a shadow. But, God, how I wish




Hed slow down, too, and turn his back on me.
