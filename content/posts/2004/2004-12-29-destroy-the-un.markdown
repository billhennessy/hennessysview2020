The United Nations serves no worthwhile purpose. The United States should immediately withdraw from the UN and banish it's buildlings from our shores. We should begin by refusing to participate in any UN emergency aid for countries victimized by the Christmas tsunami.




Why? Because America provides 40% of the total world charity while comprising less than 5% of the population, but the smug bastards at the UN call us stingy.




I hate the United Nations.
