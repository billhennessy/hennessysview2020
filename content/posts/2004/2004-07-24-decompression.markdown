Sorry that I've been absent from the blog, but I'm decompressing.  I didn't realize how much of the rest of my life had been neglected over the past two months--but I have a lot of catching up to do.    
  
I'll have much more to say next week.  Until then, have a great weekend. ![](https://blog.billhennessy.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=673)
