Just when I was ready to hand the election to Kerry thanks to the SwiftVets, the DNC makes me look stupid. I had no idea that they would do something as stupid as waste an entire Sunday trying to convince people that George W. Bush ghost-wrote the SwiftVets book, but that's just what they did.




Stupid, stupid Democrats. You were winning this one, you morons! Instead of being "presidential" and adult about it by having Kerry merely respond, "My record in the Navy is my record in the Navy," you send out drooling attack dogs like Tad Divine to lie about Bush's personal involvement.




As a result, a man with visible war wounds has turned on Kerry with vengance. Bob Dole, whose one Purple Heart cost him an arm, is obviously sick of John F. Kerry. [Read the NY Post article](https://www.nypost.com/news/nationalnews/29319.htm)
