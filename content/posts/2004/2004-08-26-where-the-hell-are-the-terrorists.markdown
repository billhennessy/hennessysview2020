[Jim Lacey, in National Review Online](https://www.nationalreview.com/comment/lacey200408250834.asp), makes some excellent points about the same thing I've wondered for some time:  where are all the terrorists?  
  
After we invaded Afghanistan, we were told that tens of thousands of well-trained fanatics were scattered around the globe, increasing their danger and allowing them to recruit more members.    
  
Well, three years later, where are they?  Why haven't they struck?    
  
Mr. Lacey's article is well worth reading as explores some possible answers to these questions.![](https://blog.billhennessy.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=625)
