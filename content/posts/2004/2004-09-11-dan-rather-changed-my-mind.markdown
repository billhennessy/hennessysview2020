For many reasons, I decided that I would not actively work for the Bush campaign this year as I did in 2000. Those reasons are personal, so I won't explain here.  
  
However, after CBS collaborated with the Democrats to cheat by creating and airing fraudulant documents, I have no choice but to join the fight. I will be spending a lot of my spare time working for the campaign here on out, so my blog might go empty for a day here and there. Forgive me. I'll be working for a higher cause.  
  
I will also urge everyone who reads this blog to call your local Bush headquarters and volunteer.
