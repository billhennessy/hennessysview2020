You have selected the better candidate for governor.  Why does a Republican care?  Well, I'm also a Missourian.  I must remind myself:  What if the Democrat wins?  On the chance that the next Missouri governor is a Democrat, I have to side with the best Democrat available.  That may not be Claire McKaskill, but it sure as hell isn't Bob Holden.  
  
Whoever wins the general election, Missouri's next governor will be better than its current one.    
  
Congratulations, Missouri.  Viva democratic-republics.
