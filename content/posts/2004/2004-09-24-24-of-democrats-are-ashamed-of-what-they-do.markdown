While only 8% of Republics are ashamed of their jobs.  What other conclusion can we draw from the fact that, according to OpenSecrets.org, 1 in 4 donors to John Kerry's campaign refuses to disclose his employer or occupation while 92% of Bush contributors proudly disclose theirs.  
  
Under federal law, candidates and parties are required to make reasonable efforts to determine the occupation and employer of all contributors.  While Republicans are frequently fined by the FEC for failing to identify the occupuations of 5-10% of donors, Democrats generally skate by with 15% non-disclosure with no fines.  Why?  Well, children, because the FEC is composed mostly of Democrats.  
  
But John Kerry's campaign is taking secret money to a new low.  Or high, depending on how you look at it.  I just hope President Bush has the manhood to call Kerry out at the debates.  "Hey, Senator, while we're at it--how come 24% of your contributors don't want anyone to know who they are and what they do, but 92% of my contributors are proud of giving to me?"
