I know that [stories about atheists being idiots](https://www.komo4.com/stories/34416.htm) should neither surprise
nor upset me. But I'd really like beat the living hell out of the
s.o.b.s who want the "Giving Tree" taken down

While I'm at it, I wouldn't mind punching whoever called it a "Giving Tree" instead of a Christmas Tree.

Screw the offended, and Sidney Stock, the lifeless nosebleed who
wants the tree taken down. What injustice? For the love of
God, Mr. Stock, live a little. If you think a tree is injustice,
you ain't been around.
