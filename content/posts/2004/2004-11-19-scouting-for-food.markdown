This Saturday, the Boy Scouts will be around to pick up the bags you filled with canned goods for their Scouting for Food program. Here's a list of the "perfect" bag:




After consulting with numerous food pantry directors in the area and seeking nutrition advice from Roberta Larson Duyff, a local registered dietitian and author of the _American Dietetic Association Complete Food and Nutrition Guide_, we compiled what we like to call the Perfect Bag. The Perfect Bag contains variety of nutrient-rich foods from all five food groups.








  * 


**2 cans of hearty soup, stew or** **chili:** Supplies many nutrients. 


  * 


**2 cans of tuna, chicken, salmon or luncheon meat **(e.g., Spam)**:** Contains protein and iron. Canned salmon is a source of calcium and omega-3 fatty acids.


  * 


**1 can of fruit:** Supplies vitamins A and C, folate, potassium, fiber and other healthy substances.


  * 


**1 can of 100 percent pure fruit juice:** Contains vitamin C and often beta carotene. 


  * 


**1 can of vegetables:** Supplies beta carotene, vitamin C, folate, complex carbohydrates, fiber and potassium.


  * 


**1 can of tomato or pasta sauce:** Contains lycopene, a healthy substance that is more available to your body in canned and cooked tomatoes than in fresh.


  * 


**1 canned meal:** Offers a variety of ingredients and nutrients.


  * 


**1 can of beans:** Contains plenty of protein, complex carbohydrates and fiber .
