[Surprise! ](https://www.washtimes.com/upi-breaking/20041213-052632-7010r.htm) Unable to even maintain their numbers in Congress through the ballot box, the Democrat leadership in the Senate will spend time "investigating" the Bush administration--without subpoena power.




They could do everyone a favor by hiring Michael Moore to conduct the investigations, and meet at Teddy's house the 3rd Friday of every month for popcorn and videos. And lots of scotch.
