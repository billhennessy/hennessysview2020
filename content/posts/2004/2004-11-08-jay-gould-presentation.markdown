Listening to Mr. Gould's presentation on Thursday, I was struck by the fact that I have a lot to do.  We have a gold mine of information available in the database.  We can use technology in many ways to enhance our outreach to the top tier contributors.  
  
I hope, in the coming weeks, to find ways to help this effort.  We will need some custom programming to maximize the value of the database.  We could also use the internet to provide some value to those potential and actual contributors.    
  
I can't wait to get to work on these efforts.  ![](https://blog.billhennessy.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=515)
