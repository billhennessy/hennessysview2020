George Bush reaches into a frecas to extract one of his Secret Service agents in Chile.

Let me repeat: The President of the United States rescued one of his body guards from a fight with other body guards.

George W. Bush is the coolest president since Teddy Roosevelt. These are the moments that define men at the pinnacle.

 The president is supposed to walk away, seek the safety of other leaders and security agents. Instead, this man jumps into the fight to rescue his protector.

Wow. Wow. Wow.

And don't miss the moronic reaction at [DemocraticUnderground](https://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=show_mesg&forum=102&topic_id=1009032&mesg_id=1009032), where idiots write that this was beneath the dignity of the office. More wow. Getting blow jobs from interns on Easter Sunday in the Oval Office is more honorable to these freaks than is rescuing a subordinate. How demonstrative. 

Update: I'm not the only one who noticed. See [Dean's World](https://www.deanesmay.com/posts/1101023733.shtml)
