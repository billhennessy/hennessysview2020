Iraq's population is about 25 million.  It's 2004 death rate is 5.66 deaths per 1,000.  The US population is more than 10 times that at just under 300 million.  Our death rate is 8.34 per 1,000.    
  
Before you go crying about all the people we are killing in Iraq, bear in mind that your chances of dying in 2004 are much, much greater here than there.  Iraq is obviously safer than the United States.
