Dick Cheney is really, really good.  He should be on more often.  He instills confidence.  
  
  
  
John Edwards on Global Test:  Yes, there is a global veto, but Senator Kerry said we will never give anyone a veto on American use of force.  Another waffle.  
  
  
  
John Kerry will never give control of the security of the United States of America to another country.  What about the UN?  Its not a country.  
  
  
  
At 8:20 PM, Cheney is ripping Edwards a new one.  Cheney should be President, Im sorry to say.   
  
  
  
8:21 PM Edwards is smirking.  
  
  
  
8:21 PM Edwards:  What the Vice President just said is complete distortion.  Plagiarizing Joe Pesci in My Cousin Vinnie.  Opening argument.  Everything dat guy just said is bullshit.  Thank you.  
  
  
  
8:22 PM:  Cheney just buried him.  If they cant stand up to the pressures Howard Dean represented, how can we trust them to stand up to Al Qaeda?  
  
  
  
8:25 PM:  Edwards is flailing.  I cant believe hes  a trial lawyer.  Must have won a lot of settlements.  He doesnt conceal his emotions.  Dick Cheney is as poker faced as a man can be.  
  
  
  
8:32:  Cheney just nailed Edwards on his continued smug besmirching of the Iraqi security.  I hate Edwards.  Hate him with a passion.  Id beat the hell out of him if I ever met him.  
  
  
  
8:32:  There are 60 countries with Al Qaeda on them.  How many are we going to invade?  Answer:  All of them, if necessary.  
  
  
  
8:39:  Fuck Edwards.  What the hell has   
  
  
  
8:42:  No Democrat has any right to talk about defending Israel.  Were it up to liberals, every Jew who isnt a registered voter in New York city would be bulldozed into a pile and set afire.  
  
  
  
8:43:  Cheney just shut him down, big time.  The first time I ever met you was when you walked on this stage tonight.  Nothing else will be remembered.  Senator, youre no Jack Kennedy.  
  
  
  
8:46:  Edwards:  He was one of 4 to vote against Head Start, Meals on Wheels, MLK Day  
  
  
  
8:47:  ClevelandThere are several things that need to be done . . . jobs.  We have to make America the best place in the world to do business, litigation, medical care.  I zero in on education.  No child left behind act was the administrations first piece of legislation and even had Ted Kennedy on board.  Accountablility.    
  
Domestic:  
  
  
  
  
  
Gay MarriageCheney.   
  
  
  
Do you feel personally attacked when Vice President Cheney talks about having a trial lawyer on the ticket?  Give me afucking break, bitch.  Why dont you just drop and suck his dick?    
  
  
  
Wow, Cheney is prepped.  Edwards, Sos your old man retorts are silly.  
  
  
  
Cheney is a better debater.  He zings Edwards at the END of his time which forces Edward to respond to Cheney without a chance to really think of a good comeback.  Edwards, on the other hand, gets in his punches at the start of his turn which allows Cheney up to a full minute to prepare.  Edwards also moves off of his zinger himself, lessening its impact.  As a lawyer, he should know that you make your best points with the last witness of the day so the jury can think about it all night.
