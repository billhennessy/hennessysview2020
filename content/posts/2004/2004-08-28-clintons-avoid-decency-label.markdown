Bill and Hillary Clinton, long disdainful of things decent, appropriate, and cultured, will hold self-glorification rituals in NYC during the RNC Convention next week.




Guests (aka, donors) will praise Bill and Hillary while handing $10,000 checks to so-called 527 organizations--DNC organs invented by Russ Feingold as the "switch" part of the bait and switch of the recently enacted Campaign Finance Reform act.




Sen. John McCain, the man who seems to make a living of getting hoodwinked by Democrats, now wants the 527 outlawed. Hey, Senator: wouldn't it be more efficient to just repeal the first amendment now and be done with it?
