Ed Gillespie on CBS's responsibilities: 


"In an effort to regain the trust of the American people CBS should not only investigate the process that led to the use of these documents but they should identify immediately those engaged in possible criminal activity who attempted to use a news organization to affect the outcome of a Presidential election in its closing days."




I would be shocked if the Kerry Campaign did NOT have a major role in the creation and/or distribution of the fraudulent documents. Of course, they did. Max Cleland seems to be involved, and he is an adviser to the campaign. There were undisputed reports early in this controversy that the Kerry campaign saw the documents before CBS News did. Did Kerry's campaign forward them to CBS?




I still say Kerry will not be the Democrat candidate come November.
