Bishops have banned public Masses, but that hasn't stopped the Mass, especially the Traditional Latin Mass.

Monsignor Eugene Morris of the Oratory of Ss. Gregory and Augustine is livestreaming the Holy Mass each Sunday at 8:00 a.m. You can watch live on [the Oratory's Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/OratorySsGregoryAugustine/). 

### How to Get the Most from the Mass in Time of Pestilence

Msgr. Morris has published a guide to keeping the Mass holy in this time of pestilence as we watch from home instead of participating in the pews. From Msgr. Morris:

What should be done with a Sunday without Holy Mass.
I would offer the following suggestions:

1. Our First Mass at the Oratory is normally 8 am. Rise in time for the 8â€™o clock hour with all family members present and spend that time prayer. I would encourage using your Missals to access the Epistle and Gospel for the Sundays we are away and read that as a family. Spend some time in silent prayer together, and then make a spiritual communion using the below prayer. You could use the following online resource to assist with readings [if you do not have a Missal](http://www.extraordinaryform.org). You
may also desire to live stream the Holy Mass. There are several resources on line to assist you [Live Mass](https://fsspjoliet.wordpress.com/2017/12/08/fraternity-ofsaint-peter-fssp-live-mass-channel) and [Holy Mass](https://www.tridentinecatholic.com). Or [the Oratory's Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/OratorySsGregoryAugustine/)

2. Pray the rosary as a family (hopefully this is already happening, but if not now is a good time to begin).

3. Make an effort to come to confession during this time of being away from Holy Mass. The times for confession are listed on the website, and in the bulletin.

4. Spend some time in spiritual reading either individually or as family.

5. Prayer for Spiritual Communion

*My Jesus,
I believe that you are truly present
in the most Blessed Sacrament.
I love You above all things
and I desire to receive You into my soul.
Since I am not able at this moment
to receive You sacramentally,
I ask that you spiritually enter into my heart.
I embrace You and unite myself wholly to You.
Never permit me to be separated from You.
Amen. (Padre Pio)*
