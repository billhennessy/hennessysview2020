If you pay attention to certain sources, you'll know exactly what to do. One of these sources is the Francis Vatican. Whatever the Francis Vatican says, do the opposite. 

Francis' Vatican recently called China the best example of Christianity in the world. Thinking people immediately treated China like the incarnation of Satan, which it is. 

When Francis defiled St. Peter's Basilica with demonic idols, thinking Christians canceled their planned trip to the Vatican 

Since the start of the Coronavirus freakshow, Francis and his minions have been calling for more globalism and the destruction of "walls." 

You're way ahead of me. 

The answer to diminishing the effects of dangerous diseases is MORE WALLS and BIGGER WALLS.  

In fact, you should memorize that. Repeat after me:

**MORE WALLS**

**BIGGER WALLS**

History agrees. 

### 

 > Ferrara is a picturesque **walled city** situated along a branch of the Po River halfway between Padua and Bologna . . .. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, Ferrara is distinguished for having some of the first paved roads in 1375 and a municipal sewer system since 1425. (Via [History.com](https://www.history.com/news/plague-italy-public-health-ferrara))

Plague ravaged Northern Italy and much of the world from 1629 to 1631. More than 45,000 died in in the Northern Italian city of Venice. Other Italian cities lost half their populations in two years. 

But the city of Ferarra was spared. In fact, Ferrara recorded zero deaths from plague after 1576. 

Why?

Researchers point to three reasons: sanitation laws, personal hygiene, and **strong border controls**.

Let's repeat those:

1. Sanitation laws.
2. Personal hygiene.
3. **Strong border controls**.

Like today, Northern Italy was an arts and commerce center. Its cities and town were cosmopolitan, attracting visitors from all over the world. The place was wide open to immigrants and visitors alike. 

Ferrara, however, was a walled city that did things a little differently than its more famous neighbors like Florence and Venice. From [History.com](https://www.history.com/news/plague-italy-public-health-ferrara):

> A team of researchers at the University of Ferrara dug through municipal archives and historical manuscripts to uncover a Renaissance-era approach to “integrated disease management.” They credit Ferrara’s remarkable success to a combination of **strict border surveillance**, aggressive public sanitation and rigorous personal hygiene regimens that tapped the natural antimicrobial properties of herbs, oils and even scorpion and snake venom

Other cities tried *some* of these measures, but the combination of all three—public sanitation, personal hygiene, and strong border controls* seemed to the most effective in stopping the plague. Again, from History.com:

> In Ferrara, the highest threat level meant closing all but two of the city gates and posting permanent surveillance teams composed of wealthy noblemen, city officials, physicians and apothecaries. Anyone arriving at the city gates needed to carry identification papers called Fedi (“proofs”) to ensure they had arrived from a plague-free zone. Then they would be screened for any signs of disease.

### Trust History, Not Globalist Popes

The Vatican doesn't believe history is a guide to public health. Its solution would surely involve sanitation and hygiene, but leave out border controls. 

What the world needs now is walls, sweet walls. No, not just a fence, but big, beautiful walls. Like the ones Trump builds.
