If you pay attention to certain sources, you'll know exactly what to do. One of these sources is the Francis Vatican. Whatever the Francis Vatican says, do the opposite. 

Francis' Vatican recently called China the best example of Christianity in the world. Thinking people immediately treated China like the incarnation of Satan, which it is. 

When Francis defiled St. Peter's Basilica with demonic idols, thinking Christians canceled their planned trip to the Vatican 

Since the start of the Coronavirus freakshow, Francis and his minions have been calling for more globalism and the destruction of "walls." 

You're way ahead of me. 

The answer to diminishing the effects of dangerous diseases is MORE WALLS and BIGGER WALLS.  

In fact, you should memorize that. Repeat after me:

**MORE WALLS**

**BIGGER WALLS**

History agrees.
