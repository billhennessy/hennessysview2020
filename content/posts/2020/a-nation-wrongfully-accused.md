When we learn that someone behind bars was wrongfully convicted, what is the minimum moral thing to do?

Thanks to DNA testing, hundreds, if not thousands, of wrongfully convicted people have been set free in recent years. When I read the stories of these poor souls—mostly men, mostly black—my heart aches. Some have been behind bars for decades. 

I imagine all the pain caused by the wrongful accusation, wrongful conviction, wrongful sentencing, and wrongful imprisonment. 

Imagine a young, innocent man pleading with his mother to believe that he didn't do it. Shaking his head as the police officer reads the charges. Insisting on his innocence through hours of interrogation. 

Imagine his mother struggling to find the money to pay an attorney, begging friends and relatives to kick in a few dollars. "I want the best lawyer I can afford for my boy," she tells her aunt. 

See the family sitting behind the accused in court, listening to the evidence against him, hoping against hope that the jury rejects the prosecutor's demand that they "spare their community another senseless (rape? murder?) at his hands." 

Imagine his mother's horror when, after reading the verdict, bailiffs haul him away, presumably for life without parole. 

Imagine, now, the middle-aged man learning that his mother has died. 

Then one day, a DNA test proves that someone committed the crime for which this man has spent most of his life in prison.

What does society owe him? 


At a minimum, society owes the man immediate release. (I would argue he's owed a lot of money for each year spent in prison and for the rest of his life, too.) But, at least, let him go. That day. Don't wait. Society was wrong. Keeping him locked while bureaucrats file paperwork is, perhaps, a greater crime than the one for which he was falsely accused and convicted. 

No, no, no. Let him go!

You and I are like that man. Wrongfully convicted of contributing to the damages of a disaster. 

### The Experts Failed Miserably

From the very start of the Chinese Coronavirus pandemic, the experts failed. At every turn, they failed. Data scientists, physicians, researchers, journalists all failed. 

They failed to understand just how irresponsible and rotten the Chinese government is. Or they turned a blind eye because the Chinese pay them to keep their mouths shut. 

They failed to place necessary cautions on their data models.

They failed to tell the truth about the effects of wearing masks. (We still don't know what the truth, so frequent and contradictory were their lies.)

But their biggest failure is happening right now. 

Two weeks ago (or more) the enormity of the failures of scientists involved in public health became undeniable to everyone. Two weeks ago, the data models most relied upon by governments in setting mitigation policies proved to be off factors of 10, 20, and 40. In every possible measure, the data models overstated the threat of Chinese Coronavirus. 

A model that projected 1 million to 2.2 million deaths now project sixty-four thousand—about the number of deaths you'd expect in an ordinary flu season. And, since most this year's flu deaths have been or will be recategorized as Coronavirus, the net number of dead from respiratory diseases this year is likely to be a wash. 

Moreover, we have been learning that the Coronavirus is no more deadly than the flu. About 1/10 of 1 percent of people who get the virus die from it, the same as H1N1 flu. While more people are susceptible to the Coronavirus than to the flu (from which about 60 percent are immune at any given time), the chances of dying from the diseases are nearly identical. 

In other words, the medical and data science communities convicted us all erroneously and then sentenced us to up to one year of house arrest. 

Now that our conviction has been proven false, they do not open the door and let us walk free. Instead, they belittle us and insult for *wanting* to be free. They mock us for demanding our basic human rights of liberty and pursuit of happiness. They insult small business owners for asking to try to rebuild their shattered businesses and wrecked lives. They threaten to extend our sentences merely for requesting release from our prisons. 

Those who wish the lockdown to continue might be acting out of fear or malice. But they are no better, regardless of their motivation, than someone who insists on leaving an innocent man in prison. 

The DNA tests are back. We didn't do it. Let us walk free before it's too late.
