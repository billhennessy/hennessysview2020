Do you wake and grab for you phone to learn the latest news about Coronavirus? 

Have you cancelled a trip? Kept your kids home from school? Told a stranger to quarantine himself because he sneezed? 

It's not your fault. You are doing exactly what the perpetrators of fear want you to do: panic. 

When you panic—when you believe you're powerless to save your life or the lives of loved ones—you're more likely to let a stranger take control of your life. In this panicked state, you're primed to give up and let the government (or the United Nations) tell you what to do. And you *want* the government telling *everybody else* what to do. 

But there's something the government and the media aren't tell you. In fact, people who tell you **the truth** about Coronavirus are shot down and ridiculed, accused of evil intent and belittled for "dismissing" a "serious threat to lives." 

But here's the truth:

About 50,000 Americans have already died from the flu this season alone. Flu will kill another 10,000 before the season ends.

How many have died from Coronavirus? 35. 

I wanted to include bar chart to show the difference, but I can't. Flu kills so many more people, the contrast is so great, that Coronavirus is **invisible** in a chart that compares it to flu deaths.
