We've all been seeing the woeful headlines from the media that hates Trump and hates America: CNN, NYTimes, Washington Post, Drudge Report, etc. The headlines combine and conspire to send a single, unmistakable message: DESPAIR. 

The headlines and stories are clearly intended to make people panic. The media want people to stay locked in their homes, and they want people to demand that government keeps the brave locked in their homes, as well. The media and the Democrats want America closed for good. 

To induce universal panic, the media tell us that "experts" say things like:

* People cannot develop an immunity to Coronavirus no matter how many times they catch it
* There will never be a vaccine for Coronavirus, and, even if there is, it's at least two years away from wide availability
* Re-opening the economy will result in millions of deaths
* Testing

(I didn't link to these stories because the stories are mere speculation and perverted wishful thinking from hopeless people, mostly scientists and journalists.)

Here's the thing: **If the first two doomsday predictions are right, if there is no hope for immunity or vaccines, then we might as well re-open everything right now**. 

In fact, if those two predictions are right, we have a moral duty to go back to normal today.

The doomsday press wants you to believe that Coronavirus is invincible and we are its prey, that stepping outside your home is suicidal, and that no cure, preventive, or immunity is possible. 

That means, logically, that eventually every human being will get the virus and probably die from it. Unless people never leave the home. It's the only way to prevent it. 

But, if you never leave your home, you will soon die of starvation. Or exposure. If meat packers and farmers and truck drivers stay home, you will run out of food. The power will go out soon, as electrical workers barricade themselves in their homes. There will be no gasoline, no diesel, no internet. Batteries will eventually die.

You won't be able to hunt or grow your own food, as that would risk going outside and possibly encountering someone else. 

And if you catch Coronavirus, if it ever gets inside your home, you and your family experience recurring bouts of the disease until you all die from it. 

That's the narrative of the mainstream media. 

If these experts are right, then we are doomed. We might as well live the best lives we can until our inevitable and near demise. We might as well abandon all the restrictions since they're only prolonging our agony. Let's live large and die young and leave a good-looking corpse. 

The only argument for prolonging the lockdown is that a reliable cure or a certain vaccine will be found before the world runs out of money, before the meatpackers all succumb to the disease, before electrical workers are too few to keep the lights on, before every major company collapses because of a lack of materials, labor, and markets. 

At some point soon, even critical businesses like hospitals (which are just for-profit corporations for the most part) will realize they're in a losing battle and shut down. Without a profit incentive, there's no reason to work. As CNN and the eggheads in academia convince more and more people that there is no hope, people will stop working and simply live out their days. 

If the experts are wrong about people developing immunity but right about the hopelessness of vaccines, then the best strategy is herd immunity. That might mean lots of deaths from the virus, but it's the only way to survive as a species. 

If the experts are right about the hopelessness of vaccines, they're probably also right about the hopelessness of immunity. A vaccine only tricks the body into creating antibodies against the virus. If we can't do that naturally, we can't do it unnaturally. 

No matter what, the best strategy for the best possible life is to ignore the "experts" and live well and logically. That involves wisdom, and **wisdom is knowing how God thinks and what God wants**. 

And, despite what modernist skeptics (like most Catholic bishops) say, we know how God thinks and what God wants from us. It was given to us just as we were given the sea and the sky and night and day and plants with fruit and animals that help us and feed us. God told us in remarkably clear language how we are to live. And one of His oft-repeated instructions goes like this:

> "Fear not, for I am with thee: turn not aside, for I am thy God: I have strengthened thee, and have helped thee, and the right hand of my just one hath upheld thee." (Isaiah 41:10)

> "Fear not; for God is come to prove you, and that the dread of him might be in you, and you should not sin." (Deuteronomy 5:20)

> "And immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying: Be of good heart: it is I, fear ye not." (Matthew 14:27)

One of the most frequent admonitions in the Bible is to fear not. Fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, but fear of creatures or fear of living is the beginning of despair. **Despair is the absence of faith. And without faith, nothing is possible**. 

Which is why CNN and New York Times preach doom and despair. Without faith, nothing is possible and everything is a threat. 

Fear not.
