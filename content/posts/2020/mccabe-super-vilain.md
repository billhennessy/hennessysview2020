Andrew McCabe was a long-time employee of the United States Department of Justice. For a longer time, he's been a Democrat partisan. We now know that he used his extraordinary legal powers to punish political opponents and protect political allies who committed crimes. 

That combination of power, influence, protection, and corruption makes Andrew McCabe one of the super villains of American history. 

### DOJ Super Powers

While the Constitution severely limits police power in the United States, Congress has, since the early 20th century, granted nearly limitless power to spy on, entrap, and prosecute  American citizens seen as threats to the country to the Federal Bureau of Investigations.

At the beginning of the FBI's existence, those threats were confined to people and organizations that sought the overthrow of the US government: communists, nazis, anarchists, and the like. Over time, though, the net broadened.

In the 1950s and 1960s, the FBI perceived an existential threat from the civil rights movement and the anti-war movement. Long-time director of the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover, successfully lobbied every president from Woodrow Wilson through Richard Nixon for more power to spy on, entrap, and subvert American political movements. Hoover even convinced President John F. Kennedy and Attorney-General Bobby Kennedy to allow the FBI to bug Martin Luther King's bedroom. 

Hoover's quest for power came with a price. For presidents to authorize clearly unconstitutional and illegal activity, the presidents expected some of the FBI's dirty work would benefit the president. To Hoover's enemies list were added names of political opponents to the administration's party. 

This *quid pro quo* of power and dirty work culminated with the Watergate scandal, after which Congress curtailed the FBI's ability to spy on American citizens. The FBI's primary mission since the mid-1970s has been to regain its lost power. 

### Police Power of the Federal Government 

Until 1937, the federal government lacked almost all police power. The 10th Amendment clearly reserves to the states or to the people all powers not expressly given to the United States government. Those enumerated powers are conveniently itemized in Article 1, Section 8. Operating a Gestapo-like agency is not listed. 

Nor has the Constitution been amended to grant the government extraordinary police power. Instead, activist courts under Franklin Roosevelt and his successors re-wrote the Constitution to create a massive and dangerous police power at the federal level. 

Because this federal police power arose without legislative intent, and because it was dictated with little thought by an activist judiciary, the police states crews virtually unchecked for over 30 years. 

As in so many ways, the current threat to liberty posed by the FBI and its operators in the Department of Justice resulted not from bad legislation but by bad and partisan judges who cleverly subverted the original intent and text of the Constitution to advance their un-American agenda. 

### How Bad Is the DOJ?

Consider this: the Department of Justice targeted and attacked an elderly private citizen knowing his bombast and braggadocio would lead him to commit the crime of making false statements to the Department of Justice--a crime one can commit even he doesn't know the person he's talking to is with the DoJ. (No, DoJ cops do not have to tell you they're cops when you ask. They are above that law, too.) 

At the same time, Andrew McCabe, Jim Comey, and other high-ranking FBI and DoJ officials were lying to a FISA court in order to discredit or overthrow the President of the United States.

The DoJ decided last week to protect criminal Andrew McCabe from prosecution while continuing to prosecute the elderly private citizen for doing the exact same thing. 

The DoJ's primary mission, then, is to protect itself and its allies, even that requires, in their minds, intimidating, framing, and arresting relatively innocent private Americans. 

It's fair to ask whether the DoJ and FBI would stop at murdering Americans who seem inconvenient.
