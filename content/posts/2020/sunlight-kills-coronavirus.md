An expert is someone who can't be fired for being wrong about everything 100 percent of the time. 

You can call that **Hennessy's Law**, and Coronavirus is proving this law iron clad. Iron clad. 

The latest confirmation of Hennessy's Law just completed. 

In March, Donald Trump and others said that warm weather would diminish the spread of Coronavirus, just as it diminishes the flu. The reason: virus that survive well in cool, dry conditions don't do well in warm, humid conditions. The heat and humidity of summer, then, would logically hurt the virus and help the people. Just like your grandmother told you. 

But the "experts," who are 95 percent progressives, immediately started screaming nonsense to the contrary. In minutes, the evil, lying fake news blasted headlines calling the President and some doctors associated with the White House liars:

All those headlines were 100% pure, unfiltered bullshit. And they were all accurate summaries of what "the experts" were saying. 

Actual tests of the effects of sunlight on humidity (aka, summer) on the novel Coronavirus shows that, like the flu, getting outside (baseball games, etc.) in the summer is good thing.

> U.S. government researchers have determined that the virus survives best indoors and in dry conditions, and loses potency when temperatures and humidity rise - and especially when it is exposed to sunlight, said William Bryan, acting head of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Science and Technology Directorate.

The problem is that "the experts" don't have a monopoly on scientific experimentation. The World Health Organization, of course, the wrongest of all experts, created cutesy, childish graphics to indoctrinate your children. 

Now, hard science is in, and the experts were 100% wrong, as usual. Experts are always wrong. Always and everywhere. Experts are always wrong. 

In the the most comprehensive study of the novel Coronavirus in actual conditions, the virus survives less than one minute in sunlight. And humidity of just 20 percent shortens that tiny lifespan. (If you're from St. Louis, 20 percent humidity causes dry skin, nosebleeds, and dizziness. We're more comfortable in 70 or 80 percent humidity. Or, as an old neighbor used to say, "if you can't see it, it ain't humid.")

USA Today's Molly Stellino wrote this on March 30:

> Friedman referred to sunlight as “virus destroying sunlight.” This is FALSE. **There is no evidence proving sunlight kills the coronavirus**. Only highly concentrated UV rays are reported to kill viruses, and the World Health Organization advises against using UV rays because they can damage skin.

Molly is probably too young and ill-educated to realize that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. The experts tested viruses (not this one, but others) under laboratory conditions, not actual environmental conditions. In the real world, sunlight kills Coronavirus. In the laboratory, UV rays at those normal for sunlight in certain places does not. But the fact that scientists can't replicate the universe inside of a laboratory isn't the same as impossibility. The assertion that sunlight kills coronavirus was not falsified by a lack of laboratory evidence. But Molly doesn't know such sophistication. 

People, people, listen to the author of Hennessy's Law. When an expert speaks, assume the opposite to be closer to the truth.
