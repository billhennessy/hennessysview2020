I wish I had never read the book *Naked Lunch*. Once in a while, though, having read it comes in handy. 

A [Gateway Pundit story about Dr. Anthony Fauci](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2020/04/wow-dr-fauci-cheered-hydroxychloroquine-success-treating-mers-coronavirus-2013-today-skeptical-weird/) reminded me of something from *Naked Lunch*. 

Dr. Benway is the chief antagonist of that wretched book. He is a sadist who advises governments on ways to keep populations compliant and submissive through fear. For example, from *Naked Lunch* by William S. Burroughs, we hear Dr. Benway explaining his methods:

> “I deplore brutality,” he said. “It’s not efficient. On the other hand, prolonged mistreatment, short of physical violence, gives rise, when skillfully applied, to anxiety and a feeling of special guilt. A few rules or rather guiding principles are to be borne in mind. The subject must not realize that the mistreatment is a deliberate attack of an anti-human enemy on his personal identity. He must be made to feel that he deserves any treatment he receives because there is something (never specified) horribly wrong with him. The naked need of the control addicts must be decently covered by an arbitrary and intricate bureaucracy so that the subject cannot contact his enemy direct.”

[Jim Hoft's story](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2020/04/wow-dr-fauci-cheered-hydroxychloroquine-success-treating-mers-coronavirus-2013-today-skeptical-weird/) recalls that in 2013, Dr. Fauci was very enthusiastic about a lab test that indicated hydroxychloriquine showed immense promise for combatting SARS. SARS and COVID-19 are both Coronaviruses. But, now, Fauci seems to be the primary obstacle preventing doctors in the US from prescribing hydroxycloroquine to Coronavirus patients, even patients who have no other options. 

Is Fauci a real-life Dr. Benway? 

> Dr. Benway is operating in an auditorium filled with students: “Now, boys, you won’t see this operation performed very often and there’s a reason for that…. You see it has absolutely no medical value. No one knows what the purpose of it originally was or if it had a purpose at all. Personally I think it was a pure artistic creation from the beginning.

> “Just as a bull fighter with his skill and knowledge extricates himself from danger he has himself invoked, so in this operation the surgeon deliberately endangers his patient, and then, with incredible speed and celerity, rescues him from death at the last possible split second…."

We know Fauci was a major Hillary supporter. But could he be intentionally making the Coronavirus epidemic worse than it needs to be? Is he pulling a Benway on America?

Over [6,000 doctors agree that hydroxychloroquine is the most effective treatment for COVID-19](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/apr/2/hydroxychloroquine-rated-most-effective-therapy-do/), a cousin to SARS. Dr. Fauci hailed hydroxychloroquine as a SARS treatment seven years ago. Has he learned something about the treatment since then? If so, why doesn't he just say that and make the data available? If he's right and 6,200 other doctors treating Coronavirus are wrong, doesn't he have an obligation to explain why they're all wrong? 

I'm not accusing Dr. Fauci, but his ambivalence toward the most effective treatment for Coronavirus (according to 6,200 doctors around the world) has intimidated doctors in the US. As I pointed out yesterday, [doctors are more afraid of their peers and their government overlords than they are of the virus](https://www.hennessysview.com/coronavirus-exposes-medicines-herd-mentality/). People die. Hospitals swell. Practitioners struggle. Families grieve. And there seems to be a cure for all of this. 

Yet, Dr. Fauci vacillates and equivocates like Hamlet. 

Or, is he maximizing the danger to play the hero like Benway? 

Lay down your cards, Doctor. Let us see your hand. And if you're bluffing, God have mercy on your soul.
