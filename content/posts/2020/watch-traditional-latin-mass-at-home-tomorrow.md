Chinese coronavirus has moved bishops around the world to shut down the Catholic Church. 

Luckily, the Traditional Latin Mass orders continue to offer the Holy Mass. And one such order livestreams Masses for the masses.

This is no substitution from the real thing, but it's about the best substitute while the bishops cower in their chanceries. 

To watch, go to [LiveMass.net](http://livemass.net/). Because the Mass is in Latin (as it should be), it doesn't matter where the Mass originates from. It's all in the Church's native tongue. There's a convenient schedule to find the Mass at the best time. 

BTW, the massive increase in viewers of these live Masses is costing the FSSP a fortune. Please donate so this wonderful apostolate can continue throughout the crisis and beyond.
