Many states are flatly denying civil rights to all citizens deemed non-essential by bureaucrats and politicians. Even many doctors have been deemed non-essential. Consider that. 

These bureaucrats have suspended the First Amendment for the non-essentials. They have:
* prohibited the free exercise of religion
* abridged the freedom of speech
* prohibited the right of the people to peaceably assemble.

They have revoked the Bill of Rights without so much as a voice vote of the legislature. 

How shall we respond? 

In 1773, Bostonians fed up with government abuses illegally boarded a ship and destroyed private property thereon. Those men believed in the rights of man, enough to act on their beliefs.

Yet, the Crown's crimes against the Colonies were nothing compared to the elimination of freedom decreed in Kentucky, Mississippi, New York, California, Michigan, and many other states. And we do nothing. 

Jefferson said the country needs a rebellion every 20 years or so, and I think he was right. Eleven years ago, we reenacted the tea party, non-criminally. Maybe we were too reserved. Maybe we should have flagrantly violated unconstitutional and immoral laws. Maybe we should have broken some shit and scared some people. 

Maybe it's time. Maybe it's time for the people to give an ultimatum to the dictators and to our pansy-ass neighbors who shriek like they've been bitten by a snake when a man walks down the sidewalk without a mask. 

Maybe it's time to assert our civil rights like free people, instead of begging for our rights like slaves.

Maybe it's time to finish the mission of 2009.

Maybe we need 10,000 pipe-bending patriots on the steps of every governor's mansion in America in war paint until the governors abdicate. 

Maybe it's time we use the pronouns appropriate for one's chromosomes: XX = she; XY = he, and there ain't no ternary operator in this equation. 

Maybe the Coronavirus is the universe's call to arms for everybody who wants to stand upright and walk like a human with inalienable rights. 

Maybe it's time to put the pencil-necks back on their heels, stammering like the frightened, fragile children they really are. 

Maybe it's time to shut down some universities, seize their billion-dollar endowments, and buy some weapons to arm the citizenry. 

Maybe it's time to put the fear of the Lord into the ungodly masses that kill babies for sport and convenience. 

Maybe it's time to do what CNN's employees have feared all their lives: launch a real movement of the Deplorables.

Maybe it's time to go back to 1773 and bring some of their manhood to the 21st century. 

That's all I've got to say tonight. God bless.
