Everywhere I've ever worked, including the Navy, I've heard "if you're sick, stay home." 

Everywhere I've ever worked, including the Navy, people are punished if they do. Especially in the private sector. 

No, companies don't fire people (usually) for staying home because they have a fever or cough. But staying home because of illness is usually a career killer.

Executives pride themselves on powering through injuries and illness. They reward people who got the job done despite a 104-degree fever from mononucleosis. 

Co-workers, too, ask, "how long is Phil going to milk this flu thing," when someone stays home for a few days in a row.

(Same goes for parents who need to tend to a sick child.) 

In other words, organizations don't mean it when they tell people to stay home when sick. 

Don't expect this "tough it out" attitude to change because of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic.
