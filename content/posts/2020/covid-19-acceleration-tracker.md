This is a live view of the most important COVID-19 metric: acceleration rates of positive tests, hospitalizations, and deaths.

Key Insight: For every week, Hospitalization rate decreases by about 9.19%.

### From My Original Tweet

The most important number regarding Coronavirus is a number none of the tracking sites or governments will tell you: acceleration. Lower acceleration of hospitalization and deaths is good. It means the number of new incidents yesterday was smaller than the new incidents from the day before. 

I have been tracking this since April 1, so April 2 is the first day available.
