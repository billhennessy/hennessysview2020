People scoff at the notion of divine intervention, but they still pray when really need something, like a medical miracle or ten thousand dollars to avoid foreclosure. And everybody hates the Catholics until they need an exorcist. 

There are a lot of ways to bring demonic influence into your life, and Americans are doing a lot of those things. I'm not just talking about seances and ouija boards and tarot cards, or even Satanism or Wicca. I'm talking about simply denying that God is God and living as if death ends it all. 

The Egyptians didn't believe in the God of Israel, the judging God Who offers eternal joy to His people and eternal rejection to the others. The Egyptians didn't believe, and disbelief cost them. Bigly. The Pharaoh and his entire army wee wiped out. The first born of every home, too. Even the first born cattle. 

Of course, the Egyptians, like the Americans, killed children.
