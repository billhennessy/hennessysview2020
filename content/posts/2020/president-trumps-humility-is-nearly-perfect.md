If I asked you, "what's the perfect act of love and humility?" you'd likely answer, "to give one's life for his neighbor."

If I asked your for the *second greatest*, you might say, "to sacrifice one's life's greatest work for his neighbor." 

Now, if I asked you, "what is Donald Trump's greatest work?" you'd probably say, "the US economy." 

Objectively, the incredible US economy since January 2017 *is* the greatest accomplishment in Trump's life. Nothing he did prior to entering politics holds a candle to this. 

Yet, Donald Trump put a torch to his life's greatest accomplishment. Why? "For love of neighbor." 

For the sake of saving lives, Donald Trump sacrificed his greatest accomplishment. Prideful men don't do such a thing. Only a truly humble man would destroy his life's work for the sake of others. 

Regardless of the fact that the Coronavirus data models were pure garbage, President Trump heeded the counsel of the (reputed) leading doctors in the world. Faced with the "experts'" guarantee that millions of Americans would die unless he shut the country down, Trump made a very humble decision. 

No, he's not self-deprecating, but self-deprecation is actually the opposite of humility. ("Humility is not thinking less of oneself. It's think of oneself less." C.S. Lewis) Yes, he brags about his accomplishments. Do these facts make him prideful? 

Not necessarily.

There is a prayer called *The Litany of Humility*. I know men who can't say it. They can't bring themselves to say it. "It's too tough," they say. 

But part of the prayer reminds me of Donald Trump. See if you can guess why from this segment:

*From the fear of being humiliated, deliver me, Jesus*

*From the fear of being despised, deliver me, Jesus*

*From the fear of suffering rebukes, deliver me, Jesus*

*From the fear of being falsely accused, deliver me, Jesus*

*From the fear of being forgotten, deliver me, Jesus*

*From the fear of being ridiculed, deliver me, Jesus* 

*From the fear of being wronged, deliver me, Jesus* 

*From the fear of being suspected, deliver me, Jesus*

President Trump has no fear of being despised, rebuked, falsely accused, ridiculed, wronged, or suspected. I'm sure he doesn't like it, but he shows no fear of those reactions and abuses from the press, from celebrities, or from other politicians. 

Donald Trump consistently does what he knows to be *right* without showing any fear of the attacks on his character. Heck, he uses Twitter to draw fire on himself to advance a greater cause.

Only a humble man would take a jackhammer to his masterpiece for the good of strangers. Trump did just that. 

Donald Trump is the humblest man I've ever seen.
