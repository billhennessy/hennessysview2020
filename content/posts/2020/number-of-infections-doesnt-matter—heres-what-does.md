Hysterical headlines scream about the number of new coronavirus infections every hour. This is a mistake. Ignore it. 

Doing some casual analytics, it's pretty obvious what drives the death rate: the number of hospitalizations in given geographic area. 

Last week I pointed out that mean averages are meaningless, even destructive if used to project into the future. One of the reasons **means are meaningless** is that diseases do not spread in a linear fashion. The skip and hop like tornadoes.

Instead, I've tried to find the known variables that seem to relate to numbers of deaths. Then, look for a logical reason why this correlation might be meaningful. 

As obvious as it sounds, of the data that's readily available to the public, the strongest logical correlative to deaths is serious cases, not number of infections.

You might think, "yeah, but the more infections, the more serious cases." Smart assertion, but the correlation between infections and serious cases is much weaker than between serious cases and deaths. Some countries with many, many cases, like Germany with almost 30,000, have very few serious cases, like Germany with 23. That's 0.0008. Low. 

Then look at Italy. 63,927 cases and 3,204 serious ones. And those are mostly in a small geographic area. That overwhelms the healthcare system, and overwhelmed healthcare systems result in more deaths. 

In the United States, we have relatively few cases at 42,000 out of 330,000,000 people, but we have 1,040 serious cases. Even 1,040 serious cases is meaningless until we know *where* those cases are. If they're all in New York City, New York City is going to have problems. Not just with coronavirus, but with everything health related. If the ER is overwhelmed, your broken arm or car crash injuries or heart attack will receive worse care than if the staff is fresh and healthy and underworked. But if 1,040 serious cases are distributed evenly around the country, it isn't a blip on the healthcare radar. 

The question isn't "how many infections," it's "how many need to be hospitalized, and where?"

Which gets me to my concern: Louisiana.
