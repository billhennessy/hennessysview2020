> And the Lord God brought forth of the ground all manner of trees, fair to behold, and pleasant to eat of: the tree of life also in the midst of paradise: and the tree of knowledge of good and evil. (Genesis 2:9)

I detached, somewhat, from the world about five weeks ago, and I've found life much more interesting because of it. 

Strangely, though, time seems to pass more quickly rather than more slowly. Days wind down before I start on the tasks I'd planned. 

And knowledge (or information) seems less important, now, than wisdom. 

### The Trap of Knowledge

In the beginning, we were warned. Knowledge can be a dangerous thing. Addictive. Corrupting. Seductive. 

God told Adam and Eve of two trees, not one, in the Garden of Eden. We all remember the one: the tree of knowledge of good and evil. We remember because we were prohibited from even touching it lest we shall die. 

The other tree—the one God recommended yet man ignores—was the tree of life. 

When you stop watching TV, severely limit your access to news, and even ignore sports, what you lose in knowledge you gain in life. You also notice the dangers of knowledge as you witness in those around you the unquenchable thirst for *more* knowledge. 

The company I work for offers a particular kind of data analysis which our clients find valuable. I've noticed, though, that each question our analysis answers tends to trigger yet more questions. No client is ever satisfied with the knowledge we give, except that this knowledge excites their desire for more knowledge. 

We advise clients to first *act on* the knowledge imparted while we research answers to the questions triggered by this knowledge. We know from experience that, if a client expects 100% certainty before acting, the opportunity will have passed or the risk realized before any action is taken. 

We know that 100% certainty is not possible, neither empirically nor emotionally. One can never be completely certain of anything in the future. Nor can we feel certain of anything in the future. We do not encourage shooting from the hip, but analysis paralysis is real and dangerous to business. Yet interesting insights almost always trigger analysis paralysis, even in bold executives. 

Is that why God forbade us from eating of the tree of knowledge? Is knowledge just another dopamine-releasing drug that feels good for a second but demands a bigger dose a moment later?

### Wisdom Is Superior to Knowledge

> Because Seneca was into practical decision making, he has been described—by academics—as not theoretical or philosophical enough. Yet not a single one of his commentators detected in Seneca the ideas about asymmetry that are central to this book, and to life, the key to robustness and antifragility. Not one. My point is that **wisdom in decision making is vastly more important—not just practically, but philosophically—than knowledge**.

— Taleb, Nassim Nicholas. Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder 

When one detaches from the world just a bit, he begins to grow in wisdom. Or, at least, to recognize its value. 

For the past two years, I have been in a role at work that limits my participation in big meetings where big decisions are made. This was a change for me, and it was humbling at first. 

But my detachment from the decisions—my lack of knowledge of how decisions were made—has opened for me a window of wisdom. Free from the obligations to defend decisions I helped make, I can see only two conditions and judge the effectiveness of the those decisions. I can see the status quo ante and the status quo post hoc. The before and after. Combined with knowing management's intent, it's far easier for me to see whether the decisions made the black box were wise or not. 

I have no doubt the decisions are knowledgable decisions. Executives bring much knowledge to the decision-making table. As with the philosophers Taleb discussed in the quotation above, executives also bring rigorous theories and well-vetted philosophies of business. 

Blind to the knowledge and theories the executives applied, I can somewhat objectively focus on the effects: did their decision achieve the desired outcome? 

Had I been involved in the decision-making process, I would have brought my own theories and philosophies to the table. I would have influenced the decision and taken on a sense of ownership. I would have judged favorably or contrarily the theories and philosophies of others. 

But I cannot because I know not what the deciders brought to the table. I know only the situation before, the decision, and its results. 

Therefore, like Seneca, I have learned to decide practically from experience rather than philosophically from theory. 

This is wisdom. 

I'm not calling myself wise. I'm just saying that lack of theoretical knowledge tends to promote wisdom. 

### Uncle Mumford on Knowledge vs. Wisdom

> Uncle Mumford said—
> 'As long as I have been mate of a steamboat—thirty years—I have watched this river and studied it. Maybe I could have learnt more about it at West Point, but if I believe it I wish I may be what are you sucking your fingers there for ?—collar that kag of nails! Four years at West Point, and plenty of books and schooling, will learn a man a good deal, I reckon, but it won't learn him the river. You turn one of those little European rivers over to this Commission, with its hard bottom and clear water, and it would just be a holiday job for them to wall it, and pile it, and dike it, and tame it down, and boss it around, and make it go wherever they wanted it to, and stay where they put it, and do just as they said, every time. But this ain't that kind of a river. They have started in here with big confidence, and the best intentions in the world; but they are going to get left. What does Ecclesiastes vii. 13 say? Says enough to knock their little game galley-west, don't it? Now you look at their methods once. There at Devil's Island, in the Upper River, they wanted the water to go one way, the water wanted to go another. So they put up a stone wall. But what does the river care for a stone wall? When it got ready, it just bulged through it. Maybe they can build another that will stay; that is, up there—but not down here they can't. Down here in the Lower River, they drive some pegs to turn the water away from the shore and stop it from slicing off the bank; very well, don't it go straight over and cut somebody else's bank? Certainly. Are they going to peg all the banks? Why, they could buy ground and build a new Mississippi cheaper.

— Mark Twain, *Life on the Mississippi*

One could argue that the Army Corp, through persistence, succeeded in applying its theory to the Mississippi and tamed it. Perhaps.

I quoted from *Life on the Mississippi* extensively in my columns in 1993. (Those columns from 1993-1996 were lost in a computer malfunction.) Nearly 100 years after Mark Twain chronicled the Army Corps of Engineers' earliest attempts to control the Mississippi River, a historic flood did exactly as Uncle Mumford said it would: take what it wants. That 500 year flood consumed land that no one believed to be vulnerable to flooding. The Army's assessments, based on their theories and book learning, said the river could not rise to heights it achieved in 1993. 

But it did. And it happened before. Not 500 years earlier, but just 111 years earlier. From *Life on the Mississippi* by Mark Twain:

> This present flood of 1882 will doubtless be celebrated in the river's history for several generations before a deluge of like magnitude shall be seen. It put all the unprotected low lands under water, from Cairo to the mouth; it broke down the levees in a great many places, on both sides of the river; and in some regions south, when the flood was at its highest, *the Mississippi was seventy miles wide!* a number of lives were lost, and the destruction of property was fearful. The crops were destroyed, houses washed away, and shelterless men and cattle forced to take refuge on scattering elevations here and there in field and forest, and wait in peril and suffering until the boats put in commission by the national and local governments and by newspaper enterprise could come and rescue them. The properties of multitudes of people were under water for months, and the poorer ones must have starved by the hundred if succor had not been promptly afforded.

The battle between knowledge and wisdom is not new to the 21st century. Mark Twain clearly preferred wisdom, as had Seneca the Roman. 

The tree of knowledge, though, entraps us like a vine, like a drug. That little device in your pocket is a slave-master. It sucks wisdom in exchange for facts. 

### What I See Now

During my 90-day break from the world, I have failed to keep perfect control over my thirst for knowledge. Some days I've stared at The Gateway Pundit or foxnews.com much longer than I should have. But, overall, my consumption of digital information is less than ten percent of normal. And I haven't been to Twitter. 

When I go several days without news, I see both myself and society the way a parent might see a struggling child. I feel torn between trying to help, wondering if I can help, hoping the child experiences a breakthrough. Throughout, there's a feeling of heartbreak and uselessness. How painful it is to see one's child miserable and doubting himself. How useless a parent feels when he realizes he cannot help. 

All around me are people chained to their phones. With television blasting banalities, they listen to even more banal videos on Facebook or Instagram. Sometimes with a laptop or tablet providing a third form of bondage to knowledge. 

Meanwhile, wisdom escapes them. Wisdom has no value, no place in a knowledge society full of knowledge workers who study metrics and search for actionable insights. 

So how do you break those chains? 

It's simple but difficult. 

Just turn the damn thing off, then distract yourself. 

Read a book. Read the Bible. Pray. Clean a room. Clean four rooms. Fix something that's broken. Make something better. 

By all means, take advantage of the internet to know *how* to fix that broken door or paint that room. But acquire knowledge (not theories) and apply them. Learn from them. Get good at something besides giggling at your phone. 

### Wisdom Comes from Doing

I can't impart wisdom. No one can. Even books by wise men like Seneca and Nassim Taleb don't impart wisdom. They impart information *about* wisdom, but not wisdom itself. 

Taleb points out that the modern believes technology is applied science. Yet, almost nothing comes about that way. Instead, everything we use is the result of trial and error (aka, acquired wisdom), not academic research (aka, knowledge). Apple started in Steve Jobs' garage, not Stanford's computer laboratory. The first Apple computer was the result of trial and error, not a VC-funded application of their doctoral theses. It should come as no surprise, then, that the most successful company in modern business was founded by a man with one semester of college which involved, mostly, drugs and audited art classes. 

Which explains why time is passing quickly for me. Without access to cheap knowledge and information, I can do, observe, and think about much larger things — larger even than the impeachment and acquittal of the President of the United States. I can think about life and death, about leaving something of value to the world, and about getting my rotting deck in order before spring. 

Yes, a functioning, safe, and inviting deck is more important than politics. It's more important precisely because I can do something about it. 

And that's what happens when you're not watching: you begin to understand what's in your control and what's not in your control. And you are humbled because almost nothing is in your control, even if you're if you're the President of the United States. 

Fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. The Lord told us not to eat of the tree of knowledge but to eat abundantly from the tree of life. Wisdom is gained only through living, not academic (or social media) research. Therefore, live, take note, and try again.
