Governors, mayors, and county executives are drunk with power, and it's our job to sober their asses up. 

Thanks to Josh Schisler and the Reopen Missouri movement, protests are a comin'. We're gonna pull good ol' fashioned 2009 on a new crop of autocrats in a two-part protest to get Missouri Working Again.

## Part One: Reopen Missouri @ State Capitol at Noon

Jefferson City, Missouri. Noon to 1:00 vehicle protest at the State Capitol. Details on Reopen Missouri Facebook page. 

## Part Two: Reopen the County @ St. Louis County Government Center

Wear a mask.

Be polite.
