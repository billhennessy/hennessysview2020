Governors, mayors, and county executives are drunk with power, and it's our job to sober their asses up. 

Thanks to Josh Schisler and the Reopen Missouri movement, protests are a comin'. We're gonna pull good ol' fashioned 2009 on a new crop of autocrats in a two-part protest to get Missouri Working Again.

## Part One: Reopen Missouri @ State Capitol at Noon

Jefferson City, Missouri. Noon to 1:00 vehicle protest at the State Capitol. Details on [Reopen Missouri Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2330933170343589/). 

## Part Two: Reopen the County @ St. Louis County Government Center

Clayton, MO. 3:30 to 5:00 p.m. Rolling (tea) Party Protest in Clayton around the St. Louis County Government Center before the County Council meets.

What else do you have to do? 

Wear a mask.

Be polite.
