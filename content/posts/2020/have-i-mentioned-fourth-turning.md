Yes, I have. Many, many times. 

About three days ago, as the news spread of our world rapidly grinding to a halt, I sent a text to some friends:

> For you Fourth Turning fans, the Climax is right on time.

If you've never read my Fourth Turning posts, now might be a good time to do so. I'll wait right here. ([Link to Fourth Turning Posts](https://www.hennessysview.com/tags/the-fourth-turning/))

Welcome back. I hope you enjoyed that. You can probably guess where this is going. 

Just in case you forgot (or didn't actual read all those old posts), here are some important quotes about the Climax.

### Is Coronavirus the Climax?

Strauss and Howe conceived many scenarios that could trigger the Crisis. Here is one:

> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announce the spread of a new communicable virus. The disease reaches densely populated areas, killing some. Congress enacts mandatory quarantine measures. The president orders the National Guard to throw prophylactic cordons around unsafe neighborhoods. Mayors resist. Urban gangs battle suburban militias. Calls mount for the president to declare martial law.

The authors note that it's unlikely that any of the scenarios they proposed would actually happen the way they described. But *something* will happen. 

What happened was the financial crisis. That kicked off the crisis era. 

Some people say the financial crisis started in 2008, but I not me. The crisis began in 2007 with the collapse of Northern Rock. That's when everyone in banking knew the game was over.  Central banks held the world together with Scotch tape until the wheels came off in March 2008 with the collapse of Bear Stearns, which is what everyone remembers. But most of 2008 was a facade. The financial world wasn't even on fumes...it was coasting to a stop. 

That early 2007 period is best captured in this paragraph from [Michael Lewis's masterpiece, *The Big Short*](https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B003LSTK8G&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_9eDFEbXFDVM4X):

> In the murky and curious period from early February to June 2007, the subprime mortgage market resembled a giant helium balloon, bound to earth by a dozen or so big Wall Street firms. Each firm held its rope; one by one, they realized that no matter how strongly they pulled, the balloon would eventually lift them off their feet. In June, one by one, they silently released their grip. By edict of CEO Jamie Dimon, J.P. Morgan had abandoned the market by the late fall of 2006. Deutsche Bank, because of Lippmann, had always held on tenuously. Goldman Sachs was next, and did not merely let go, but turned and made a big bet against the subprime market—further accelerating the balloon’s fatal ascent.* When its subprime hedge funds crashed in June, Bear Stearns was forcibly severed from its line—and the balloon drifted farther from the ground.


*The Fourth Turning* explained, as previously posted in 2017:

> If the Crisis catalyst comes on schedule, around the year 2005 [it was two years late], then **the climax will be due around 2020**, the resolution around 2026. What will America be like as it exits the Fourth Turning? History offers no guarantees. Obviously, things could go horribly wrong—the possibilities ranging from a nuclear exchange to incurable plagues, from terrorist anarchy to high-tech dictatorship. We should not assume that Providence will always exempt our nation from the irreversible tragedies that have overtaken so many others: not just temporary hardship, but debasement and total ruin. Since Vietnam, many Americans suppose they know what it means to lose a war. Losing in the next Fourth Turning, however, could mean something incomparably worse. It could mean a lasting defeat from which our national innocence—and perhaps even our nation—might never recover. As many Americans know from their own ancestral backgrounds, history provides numerous examples of societies that have been wiped off the map, ground into submission, or beaten so badly they revert to barbarism.

I'm not saying we're headed for doom. In fact, I'm with Trump. I think we'll emerge from this Crisis era stronger than ever. 

### Every Working Generation Must Give

But to come out of this stronger than ever, some things will have to give. And the giving needs come from three generations. From *The Fourth Turning*: 

> The 13ers' gravest Fourth Turning duty will be their society's most important preseasonal task: to ensure that there can indeed be a new High, a new golden age of hope and prosperity. For the Crisis to end well, 13ers must keep Boomers from wreaking needless destruction and Millennials from marching too mindlessly under their elders' banner. They will not find it easy to restrain an older generation that will consider itself far wiser than they, and a younger one that will consider itself more deserving. For this, 13ers will require a keen eye, a deft touch, and a rejection of the wild risk taking associated with their youth.

In summary:

* Boomers need to put down their bombs and recede.
* Gen Xers need to grow up and take charge.
* Millennials need take orders from realist leaders, not "visionary" geriatrics. 

### We Are Approaching the Climax

I don't know how the Climax will unfold. I don't even know if coronavirus is the Climax. But I am confident we are approaching the Climax. 

The Climax of the last cycle was World War II. The cycle before, the Civil War. Before that, the Revolutionary War.

Besides "the," the most frequently used word in the previous paragraph was "war." Is that why Trump insists on calling the fight against coronavirus a "war?" Maybe. Trump learned a lot from Steve Bannon, and Steve Bannon is also a *Fourth Turning* student. Maybe Trump believes we need a war to get out of the Crisis, and a war against a virus is less deadly than a war against China or a civil war. 

But it's clear that America cannot continue on the path we've been on. Beginning with the orchestrated attacks against George W. Bush, America has become an uncivil country. There is no "senatorial" debate anymore. Issues are fought exclusively on the impugned character of their advocates. (Sadly, I helped and continue to help aggravate this problem.) 

Adding to the untenable state of affairs is the incredible ignorance and disdain for wisdom in our culture. Education rejects everything older than last week. Millennials have nearly no knowledge of any event or person from before their own lifetimes. Business leaders no longer know anything about what their businesses actually do, only about the theory of business. 

The Climax is great shake-up in which important things become obviously important again. And we need that, however painful the shaking might be. 

An older colleague of mine, approaching retirement five years ago, was asked when things changed at our company. When everything became so damn hard to do. When we stopped making money and started cutting costs and revenue instead.

He thought for a moment and said, "When the World War Two guys retired."

It makes sense. People who were on the front lines of a Climax knew that, once they survived they were playing with house money. And losing house money isn't a reason to lose your head. 

My friend explained: "You could go to these guys with an idea. 'How much could we make?' they'd ask. 'Well, it looks like about five million a year each time we sold it.' Then, they'd ask, 'how much could we lose?' and I'd say, 'probably a couple hundred thousand if no one bought it.' And they'd say, 'hell, then do it!'"

### What Comes Next Is the High

If Trump and I are right, the Climax will end in what Howe and Strauss call a "High." Think of the period from VJ Day to Kennedy's assassination, the period commonly remembered as "The Fifties." From [*The Fourth Turning*]():

> The First Turning is a High, an upbeat era of strengthening institutions and weakening individualism, when a new civic order implants and the old values regime decays.
