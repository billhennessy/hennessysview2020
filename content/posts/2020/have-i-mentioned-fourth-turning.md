Yes, I have. Many, many times. 

About three days ago, as the news spread of our world rapidly grinding to a halt, I sent a text to some friends:

> For you Fourth Turning fans, the Climax is right on time.

If you've never read my Fourth Turning posts, now might be a good time to do so. I'll wait right here. ([Link to Fourth Turning Posts](https://www.hennessysview.com/tags/the-fourth-turning/))

Welcome back. I hope you enjoyed that. You can probably guess where this is going. 

Just in case you forgot (or didn't actual read all those old posts), here are some important quotes about the Climax.

### Is Coronavirus the Climax?

Strauss and Howe conceived many scenarios that could trigger the Crisis. Here is one:

> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announce the spread of a new communicable virus. The disease reaches densely populated areas, killing some. Congress enacts mandatory quarantine measures. The president orders the National Guard to throw prophylactic cordons around unsafe neighborhoods. Mayors resist. Urban gangs battle suburban militias. Calls mount for the president to declare martial law.

The authors note that it's unlikely that any of the scenarios they proposed would actually happen the way they described. But *something* will happen. 

What happened was the financial crisis. That kicked off the crisis era. 

Some people say the financial crisis started in 2008, but I not me. The crisis began in 2007 with the fall of Lehman Brothers. We held the world together with Scotch tape until the wheels came off in September 2008, which is what everyone remembers. But most of 2008 was a facade. The financial world wasn't even on fumes...it was coasting to a stop. 

Here's another quote from *The Fourth Turning* which I previously posted in 2017:

> If the Crisis catalyst comes on schedule, around the year 2005 [it was two years late], then **the climax will be due around 2020**, the resolution around 2026. What will America be like as it exits the Fourth Turning? History offers no guarantees. Obviously, things could go horribly wrong—the possibilities ranging from a nuclear exchange to incurable plagues, from terrorist anarchy to high-tech dictatorship. We should not assume that Providence will always exempt our nation from the irreversible tragedies that have overtaken so many others: not just temporary hardship, but debasement and total ruin. Since Vietnam, many Americans suppose they know what it means to lose a war. Losing in the next Fourth Turning, however, could mean something incomparably worse. It could mean a lasting defeat from which our national innocence—and perhaps even our nation—might never recover. As many Americans know from their own ancestral backgrounds, history provides numerous examples of societies that have been wiped off the map, ground into submission, or beaten so badly they revert to barbarism.

I'm not saying we're headed for doom. In fact, I'm with Trump. I think we'll emerge from this Crisis era stronger than ever. 

### Every Working Generation Must Give

But to come out of this stronger than ever, some things will have to give. And the giving needs come from three generations. From *The Fourth Turning*: 

> The 13ers' gravest Fourth Turning duty will be their society's most important preseasonal task: to ensure that there can indeed be a new High, a new golden age of hope and prosperity. For the Crisis to end well, 13ers must keep Boomers from wreaking needless destruction and Millennials from marching too mindlessly under their elders' banner. They will not find it easy to restrain an older generation that will consider itself far wiser than they, and a younger one that will consider itself more deserving. For this, 13ers will require a keen eye, a deft touch, and a rejection of the wild risk taking associated with their youth.

In summary:

* Boomers need to put down their bombs and recede.
* Gen Xers need to grow up and take charge.
* Millennials need take orders from realist leaders, not "visionary" geriatrics.
