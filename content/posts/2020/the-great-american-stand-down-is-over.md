Today, President Trump nailed it. 

\> “What we did was we closed everything down. That was our public health strategy. Just close everything, all businesses, old workers, young people, old people, short people, tall people. Every school closed, everything.”

\> “If you rethought that or had time to analyze that public health strategy, I don't know that you would say quarantine everyone. I don't even know that that was the best public health policy. Young people then quarantined with older people was probably not the best public health strategy because the younger people could have been exposing the older people to an infection."

He concluded:

\>  “We have to do both. We’re working on it.”

Oh, wait. I'm sorry. Did I tell you President Trump said that today? I was wrong. President Trump said something like that \*yesterday\*. And the day before. 

No, those quotes didn't come from the president. They came from Andrew Cuomo, governor of New York. 

Now, when Trump said words to that effect, the fake news media, leftist doctors, and moron pundits went berserk. At press conferences, hyperventilating New York Times reports \*screamed\* at the president, "people are going to DIE!"

What do those leftist idiots do now? Now that the Great White Hope of the Democrat Party has endorsed President Trump's get-back-to-work strategy? 

I'm guessing the New York Times and the Washington Post will print front page apologies to the president for reflexively denigrating another brilliant idea from Mr. Trump, right? I mean, isn't that the only decent thing for them to do?

Dr. Fauci, whatever his merits, isn't president. He's not responsible for the American economy or the US military, or trade negotiations. Fauci's view of the world is as narrow as plastic straw. He's a doctor. 

We didn't elect Dr. Fauci president. We elected Donald Trump. President Trump has lent remarkable deference to the epidemiologist and virologists in and around government. He did exactly what they asked: a 15-day national stand-down. 

Well, those 15 days end next Tuesday. It's time for President Trump to wrestle control of the country from medical specialists and, weighing their sound advice, get America moving again. 

And, if you think I'm just another Trump fanboy endorsing whatever falls out of Trump's Twitter feed, go back to the top of this post and read what Saint Andrew Cuomo says. (It's the same thing.)
