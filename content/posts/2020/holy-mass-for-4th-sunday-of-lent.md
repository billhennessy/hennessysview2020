Monsignor Eugene Morris livestreamed his private Mass for the fourth Sunday in Lent today. The Mass is preceded by the Most Holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary. 

Monsignor's wonderful homily is worth sharing with everyone you know. 

I apologize that I did not see this earlier.

You will see why I fell in love with the Oratory of Ss. Gregory and Augustine.
