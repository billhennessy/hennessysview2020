Donald Trump is big inconvenience to the Chinese Communists dictators. We all know that. But would the Chinese Communist dictators unleash a deadly pandemic just to get rid of Trump? You bet. 

Most of the Millennial generation has no memory of the Tiananmen Square massacre, but the adults do. In 1989, Chinese students wanted more freedom. They saw the Soviet Union breaking apart and a breeze of freedom sweep across Eastern Europe. These students wanted a whiff of that fresh air. 

Instead, the students got run over by tanks and shot by Communist soldiers.

That was 1989. Not really that long ago. 

Instead of taking a moral position against the Chinese Communists, the United States under George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton congratulated the Communists on quelling the unrest, allowing American corporations to surrender intellectual property rights in peace. 

George W. Bush and Barack Obama continued to appease and enrich the ChiComs, closing their eyes to China's increasing inhumanity the way so many "leaders" ignored the growing evil of the Third Reich. 

Pope Francis, likewise, surrendered the Church in China to the Communist Party, allowing the Chinese Communist Dictator to appoint bishops. (Yes, you heard that right. Francis reports to Xi now.) A top Vatican official and close confidant of Pope Francis  recently praised the Communist, atheist Chinese dictators: "those who best realize the social doctrine of the church are the Chinese." Bishop Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo went to heap prize on the atheist dictators. Via [World News Daily, February 12, 2018](https://www.wnd.com/2018/02/vatican-china-best-example-of-churchs-social-doctrine/): 

> I found an extraordinary China; what people do not know is that the central Chinese principle is 'work, work, work.' ... As Paul said: 'He who does not work does not eat.' You do not have shantytowns; you do not have drugs; young people do not have drugs. There is a positive national consciousness â€” they want to show that they have changed; they already accept private property."

> Continuing in his lavish praise of Chinese-style Communism, Sorondo said "they \[the Chinese] seek the common good, subordinate things to the general good." China, he added, has "defended the dignity of the human person" and, in the area of climate change, is "assuming a moral leadership that others have abandoned."

Past US administrations and even the Pope were useful idiots to the Communist Chinese dictators. 

Then came Trump. 

While lavishing Dictator Xi with personal praise, Trump went about dismantling the idiotic trade deals with China signed by his four immediate predecessors.  Trump launched a trade war that saw the US economy outperform the world while China sunk into a deep economic depression. During this time, the Communist Chinese dictators saw new rebellion and protests from young people, similar to 1989. 

Trump is pain in the dictator's butt. 

Conveniently, China has enough people for its dictator to experiment on. Since atheist Communists have zero regard for human life (except their own), the coronavirus served as useful tool to plunge the United States into a recession, risk Trump's re-election, and distract the world from China's relentless pursuit of world domination. 

If you want to fix blame on anyone for the coronavirus outbreak and its consequences, the only culprit here is Communist China and the idiots and fellow-travelers in the West, including our former presidents and the pope.
