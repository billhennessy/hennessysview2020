Humility is one of those things I'm always planning on getting around to but never quite do. Just like the short book on humility I've started but never finished. 

God is patient, but He has His limits, too. The coronavirus situation seems to be an example of His patience with our pride having run out. Humility has been imposed.

Maybe we should look at what a more humble world might look like. 

### What Is Humility?

The best definition of humility I can think of comes from the great C.S. Lewis:

> Humility is not thinking less of yourself; it's thinking of yourself less.

Most people, it seems, think humility is *appearing* to think less of oneself. We exalt self-deprecation. 

But self-deprecation is actually pride. Believe me, I'm never more proud of myself than when I drop a really clever self-deprecation line on someone. I do it in meetings, I do it with clients, I do it with everyone. It's become a reflex, and it's 100% pride. 

This shouldn't be a surprise. Look, again, at C.S. Lewis's definition: thinking of oneself less. The subject of self-deprecation is self. The truly humble person would put himself down; he wouldn't think enough of himself to do so. 

Let's stick with Lewis's definition as we imagine the humble world ahead. 

### A Humble World Would Be Unrecognizable

Beginning in about 1968, self became the center of the universe in every aspect of life in the developed world. Remember the mid-1970s? We referred to it then as the "Me Generation." 

The "me" gene is clearly dominant, as That 70s Generation gave birth (literally) to two generations of me-me-me. My Generation X, the 13ers, the generation nobody watched exuded individualism and iconoclasm the way Millennials exude tattoos. 

Millennials, meanwhile, are individually shocked to learn that they're part of the largest generation in American historyâ€”they each thought they were the only one. Each Millennial believes the universe is simulation . . . except for himself. To the Millennial mind, God graciously created a massive first-person simulation game with interesting characters for the Millennial to interact with.
