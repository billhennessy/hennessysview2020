Many people, including many conservative bloggers, believe that justice has been served in Florida.  Terri Schiavo should be starved to death as ordered by Judge Greer.  (And, please, don't insult my integrity or intelligence by claiming he ordered otherwise.  His order prohibits anyone from giving the woman food, water, or any other nutrients.  He ordered her starved to death, not denied artificial support.)  Well, I think that most of the people who support her murder must be ignorant of what they wish for.  Please read [this Ananova account ](https://www.ananova.com/news/story/sm_503675.html)of what Terri is going through even as I type.



> Animal welfare officers are investigating a horrific case of cruelty in which a dog was starved to death.

The emaciated body of the red setter was discovered in an Aberdeen cemetery.

The Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said it would forward the case to the procurator fiscal if it manages to trace the dog's owners.

Inspector Alison Adam is furious over the treatment of the animal, which she said had been deliberately starved to death.

"This is a horrific case. They starved it to death and they obviously waited until she was dead and then they dumped her.

"The last six weeks of its life were probably a living hell, this dog has gone through a couple of months of suffering.

"I find it particularly bad that somebody has obviously watched the dog in a house deteriorating to the point until it was lying in a corner.

"What's worse for me is that the person who had this dog can just go out and buy another one.

"We will go to the procurator fiscal and we will look to get them banned."



If only Terri Schiavo had an owner we could prosecute.  God forbid anyone should die this way in the richest country that ever existed and in the state that some believe paradise.

UPDATE:  [John Hawkins ](https://www.rightwingnews.com/archives/week_2005_03_20.PHP#003609)at Right Wing News shares his epiphany.  This is must reading for conservatives, like Glenn Reynolds and James Joyner, who are afraid to side with life.


> What it all comes down to for me is that if you're going to stand back and allow a woman to starve to death in a hospital death, then at a minimum you should be sure that she's a vegetable. Given the conflicting testimony in this case, I just don't see how anyone can say that fact has been definitively established.



UPDATE:  A sickening abandonment of human feelings from [Glenn Reynolds ](https://instapundit.com/archives/021896.php)and his readers:


> VARIOUS PEOPLE seem to think I should have an opinion of the Terry Schiavo case. I've tried, but I really just don't. I think I'll let Randall Terry and James Wolcott fight this one out without me. If you want more, Sissy Willis seems to be providing some pretty balanced coverage.

UPDATE: Reader Harvey Schneider emails: "You have no opinion on Terri Shiavo! Good, because neither do I. Other than it sounds complicated, tragicand really none of my business."

Yeah, that's pretty much how I feel. 



Lord, I hope I never find myself in a foxhole with these two "gentlemen."   It would be nice if Mr. Reynolds cared just enough to spell "Terri" correctly.
