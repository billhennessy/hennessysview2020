There's not much to say.  Judges have determined, in logical order, the following:

A.  Michael Schiavo is Terri Schiavo's husband; therefore,
B.  Michael Schiavo is Terri's legal guardian; therefore,
C.  Michael Schiavo's desires trump laws of the state and of morality.

Florida law does not permit the execution of a person in Terri Schiavo's condition. The judges (like Glenn Reynolds and James Joyner and others) are too cowardly to come out and say, "Look, people, the mentally ill make us kind of sick.  Like Dwight Yoakam said in Sling Blade, 'You know _re_tards and midgets make we physically ill, Linda.  I ain't sayin' it's right; it's just the way I am.'" So the judges return to an earlier day when men were expected to discipline their wives.

Terri Schiavo had the poor judgement to lose signficant mental capacity.  Obviously, that pissed off her husband.  He's simply exercising his rights as master of the house.

Why didn't I see this before?

Seriously, this is a sad day for justice in America.  The 14th Amendment no longer applies to the mentally ill.

[Beth offers more convincing evidence ](https://bamapachyderm.com/archives/2005/03/21/hammesfahr-terri-could-be-fed-orally-if-allowed/)that Terri could be fed orally, inceasing the possibility of federal murder charges against Judge Greer and Michael Schiavo should Terri die. Beth, the fountain of information that she is, also informs us that the Florida Senate is only three votes from saving Terri's life:


> We just need THREE state Senators to change their minds and vote with us to save Terri Schiavo
