In Minnesota, a wierd kid who (supposedly) got picked on a lot decided to avenge himself by killing lots of people, including his grandparents.

I think, not so much of the killer, but of the other kids, even the bullies.  Yesterday, they had plans.  Today, they have wings.



> Hegstrom described the shooter grinning and waving at a student his gun was pointed at, then swiveling to shoot someone else. "I looked him in the eye and ran in the room, and that's when I hid," she told The Pioneer. ([source](https://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,151085,00.html))



So does this kid become  tree for killing himself?  Is he boiling in oil?  These multiple, mortal sin types hadn't evolved in Dante's day.

In the death camp that America has become, what do we really expect?

_Eternal rest grant unto them, o Lord, and let the perpetual light shine upon them.  May their souls and the souls of all the faithful departed, through the mercy of God, rest in peace.  Amen._
