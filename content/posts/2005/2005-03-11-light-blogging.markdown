Sorry for my absence the past few days. (Judging by the hit count, though, I wasn't too missed.) I have to get my book proposal out the door this weekend, and much work remains. Please check out [Michelle Malkin](https://michellemalkin.com), [Donagel Express](https://www.donegalexpress.net/), [Dean Esmay](https://www.deanesmay.com/), [Steven Taylor](https://www.poliblogger.com/),[ Stephen Bainbridge](https://www.professorbainbridge.com/), [Right in Texas](https://rightintx.blogspot.com/), and the other excellent blogs in my blogroll.




Thanks,




Bill
