I must say this is good news. An indictment by a US grand jury is one of only two ways to get to the bottom of the scam, and the only hope for putting the criminals behind bars. Any internation tribunal would be a show ending cenusre or less. The other way, of course, is to try the bastards in Iraq, right along with Saddam Hussein.
