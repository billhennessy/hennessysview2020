No, really, of course.  [RomanCatholicBlog ](https://romancatholicblog.typepad.com/roman_catholic_blog/2005/07/synoid_of_bisho.html)tells us at the the next time the Bishops get together, they might, just might, address the problem of horrible, rancid, loud, profane music at Mass.

I'm sure all those who have complained about the music weren't [inspired by my blog](https://www.hennessysview.com/?p=781).  More likely, they were inspired by the same Holy Ghost that inspired me.
