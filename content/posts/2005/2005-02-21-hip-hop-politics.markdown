You might have caught my[ running, er, conversation ](https://blog.billhennessy.com/blogs/hennessys_view/archive/2005/02/17/1115.aspx) (expand comments) with someone calling himself SoupMan. After a few shots at him (some unfair, I admit), he disclosed the link to his blog, [Hip-Hop Politics](https://hiphoppolitics.blogspot.com/). I took a look around. I wasn't surprised by anything. Obviously, I don't agree with anything, but nothing was shocking.




Mr. SoupMan was reluctant to share his link with me. He didn't want hassles he'd experienced before. I suspected that I'd attack him mercilessly, which did surprise me.




Anyway, if you get a chance, check out his site. But please, please, be polite. We're guests on each others blogs--not family.
