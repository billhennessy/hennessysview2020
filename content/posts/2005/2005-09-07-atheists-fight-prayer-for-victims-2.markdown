Yes, the headline is too absurb to be fiction:



## Atheists: No prayer for disaster victims




### U.S. group says president violating Constitution by urging pleas to God



Despite their hatred of religion, the Atheists are strongly admonishing their members to contribute both money and effort to the relief of hurricane stricken areas.

"Anyone who looks upon the destruction, death, and suffering in Louisiana and turns his back risks  . . . getting . . . a really bad reputation  . . . in some circles," said association president Ellen Johnson.  She quickly added, "Not there's anything wrong with that."

Instead of prayers, the American Atheists encourage their members to read debunked, 18th century psuedo-scientific pamphlets on phrenology and eugenics.
