> Authorities said that John Evander Couey (_search_) admitted that he abducted Jessica from her bedroom more than three weeks ago. He also told them the general area where the young girl's body could be found, according to police.

](https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/0_22_lunsford_jessica.jpg)What could sound more trite than to say, "At least they know?" As with Laci Peterson's parents and Ron Goldman's father, it's now up to this sweet little girl's daddy and grandparents whether evil prevails. Her killer has done all he can after the fact. He more or less allowed his capture at the St. Patrick's Day Parade. He admitted to killing the precious girl, and he directed authorities to her body.


> Dawsy said Couey confessed after taking a lie detector test given by a polygraph investigator who had traveled to Augusta. After the test was finished, Couey told detectives that "you don't need to tell me the results. I already know what they are," Dawsy said. "He apologized to the investigators for wasting their time," Dawsy said


As I said in [my original post ](https://hennessysview.com/?p=64)on the subject, of all the missing girls (and one is too many), this one touched me in some way that I can't account for--unless it's Jessica's physical similarities to a little girl I knew who left us too soon by our clocks. I pray Jessica Lunsford's existence is so vastly richer than anything we can imagine. I pray that John Evander Couey freed her from the confines of this wretched world into a wold of splendor beyond our dreams.

Selfishlessly, though, I wish I'd never heard her name and that her father or grandparents were tucking her safely into bed tonight.

_Eternal rest grant her, o Lord, and let the perpetual light shine upon her. May Jessica's soul, and the souls of all the faithful departed, through the mercy of God, rest in peace._
