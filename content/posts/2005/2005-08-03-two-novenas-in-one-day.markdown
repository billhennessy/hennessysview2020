That's how important my present petition is.  I said two, one-day novenas today--one to Our Lady of Perpetual Help, one to Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal.  (For the non-Catholics, they're both the same person.)

First, I want to publicly thank Our Lady for her gracious intercession.  I know that if my request is not opposed to God's holy Will, it will be done.

Second, just in case, if you happen to be praying for things, please drop my name with the Almighty.  (It makes little difference to me of which denomination you might be.)

Thanks in advance for the prayers.
