If there's anyone on this planet whose presence depresses the hell out of me, it's that brainless windbag Janeane Garofalo. Not that I needed more reasons to despise her, but [A Little More to the Right ](https://www.alittlemoretotheright.com/journal/00002120.html)found one. I haven't seen this anywhere else, so take a read. Money quote:
