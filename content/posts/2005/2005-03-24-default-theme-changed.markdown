Blogrolling and other linked services have become so slow that I switched my default theme.  This way, my blog will load even if technorati, sitemeter, etc. are down or slow.

If you like the style, use the theme switcher--it was called Grubby Slipcovers.  Of course, if you're a minimalist, I have the WP defaults available, too.
