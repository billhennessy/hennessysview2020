You know, the liars who pollute science with this trash bother me, but not as much as the idiots on the street who believe it. Particularly, the teachers in this country who became teachers, not to educate, but to indotrinate. My kids have experienced these monsters numerous times. Three years ago, I got a teacher to drop a math book--MATH--because every word problem involved things like, "Scientists have concluded that most of the islands in the South Pacific will be drowned because of global warming . . . "




It's time we teach our kids, at home, to debunk teachers and leftist textbooks in the class room. I'm not a big fan of uppity kids, but I'm absolutely opposed to leftists indoctrination in the schools.
