> Messianic Jews, like Christians, believe that Jesus (or as they refer to him, Y'Shua) was the expected Messiah.

Let us pray that the ecumenism toward Jews started by John Paul II and continuing under Benedict XVI will lead more of our elder brothers to realize that our Messiah has come, was killed by and for our sins, is risen, and will come again in glory.
