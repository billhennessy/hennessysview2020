My old hosting provider should have never gotten into the business. Over the past two weeks, I've been moving all of my sites to [WebHost4Life.com](https://www.WebHost4Life.com/default.asp?refid=whennessy). I just had my first need for technical support, and my problem was resolved in just 23 minutes. The the provider took weeks to respond, if he responded at all.   
  
I strongly recommend [WebHost4Life.com](https://www.WebHost4Life.com/default.asp?refid=whennessy) if you need excellent ASP.NET hosting at the best prices in the world.
