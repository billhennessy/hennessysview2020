Besides instantly becoming the most despised college professor in America--not an easy thing to achieve, by the way--Ward Churchill recieved two doses of bad news today:




First, though he claims 1/16 Cherokee, the tribe he claims to belong to says "[he's not one of us." ](https://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_3519179,00.html)His name is nowhere in their database, so he's not a member.
