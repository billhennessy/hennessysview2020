The drooling juveniles on DemocraticUnderground took time out from praising terrorists, defending rapists, and seeking relief for child molesters to decry the White Houses use of a nine-year-old to promote Social Security Reform.




Heres a sample of what the losers are saying:

>> Why, pray tell is the mother allowing this? It is one thing to encourage your child to read and develop their own opinions, but to allow others to exploit those earliest opinions of childhood (which most of us may recall, DO change over time)....

Seriously, people who use their kids as propagandists are scum.

>> of this childs parents. To let their offspring prostitute for the Bu$h family evil empire. Just when you think the GOP can`t sink any lower. They prop up some little boy from their evil abyss. Users and abusers sure defines the repukes well.

>> 
>> Never mind that liberals have used children as political tools for years. (The Daisy commercial?) Never mind that liberals are systematically taking over the education industry for the purpose of indoctrinating young minds. Republicans are evil because they use a live 9year-old to demonstrate mathematical facts.

How about a quick round up of recent commie-lib exploitation of kids:

> The Ithaca Catholic Worker, a communist offshoot of Ithacas local Catholic Church, put a shy pre-teen girl named Leah Grady Sayvets in front of a local television camera and began asking her questions about the war on terrorism. The exchange between a middle-aged female reporter and the little girl went as follows: 
> 
> 

> 
> **Reporter**: "Let me make it easy. If someone does something violent to you, should you strike back at them?" 
> 
> 

> 
> **Leah**: "No. I think you should talk to them and see what they think is wrong. What they havewhats wrong..." 
> 
> 

> 
> **Reporter**: "So you think it's better to talk out problems?" 
> 
> 

> 
> **Leah**: "Yeah." 
> 
> 

> 
> **Reporter**: "Do you think George Bush is acting like a bully on the playground." 
> 
> 

> 
> **Leah**: [Giggles] "Yeah."

But it gets better. In this very thread in which liberals decry the use of a 9year-old boy, they turn right around and look for a 9year-old girl to counter-exploit.

Anyone have a bright 9 year old kid who would volunteer? I thought of a female, because it would have more PR value but any Dem 9 year old would be great.

Did not! Did too!  
  
I know a clever 10-year-old boy who hates Bush with a passion. I have a mind to recruit him--he's very argumentative and doesn't lose many arguments--to counter this little brat!

UPDATE: Another DU poster demonstrates that political correctness ends at the doors of the Democrat party:

UPDATE: You just knew that the [Daily Kos ](https://www.dailykos.com/story/2005/2/27/17494/0758)would have to spew some lies about the kid. And [Talking Points Memo ](https://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/week_2005_02_27.php#004933)continues its marathon against doing anything but sitting around in a catatonic freeze
