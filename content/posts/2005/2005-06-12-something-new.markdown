Hey, I realize that my readership has dropped from about 1,000 a day to a handful a day since I left the world of politics to concentrate on God.  I don't care.  Well, I do.  It's symptomatic of the reason I turned toward God:  this world loves sin, lies, and death.  It hates goodness, truth, and life.

In my return to the Holy Mother church, I am so fortunate that my parish has a Perpetual Adoration chapel.  This is new.  We didn't have such a thing when I was growing up.

Perpetual Adoration is a beautiful thing.  At least one person prays, sits, kneels before the exposed Blessed Sacrament continuously.  I have 6:00-7:00 Tuesday mornings.  Sitting before Jesus' flesh for one hour humbles more deeply than anything I've ever experienced.

I don't miss readership, but I wish one didn't have to choose between popularity and faith.  I pray that people will prove me wrong.
