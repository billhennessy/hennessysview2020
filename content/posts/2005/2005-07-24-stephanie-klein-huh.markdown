I saw that the number one search phase on Technorati for the past 3 hours has been [Stephanie Klein](https://stephanieklein.blogs.com/greek_tragedy/).  I looked up her blog (she's a blogger), and read a couple of entries.  Pretty good writing, but I don't get the mania.

Does anyone know what the deal is?  Is she famous for anything besides blogging?
