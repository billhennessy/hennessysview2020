Heres a telling quote from St. Louis Post-Dispatch sports columnist [Bernie Miklasz](https://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/sports/stories.nsf/ncaatournament/story/EA855A22C2CFFE3B86256FC700658130?OpenDocument):

> McGwire was such a disappointment. He showed no guts. If he isnt going to take a stand and defend himself against steroids accusations in such a highly publicized and open setting, then I no longer feel compelled to give him the benefit of the doubt on this issue. And **Tony La Russa** and others who have defended McGwire with such vigor are being made to look like fools. Mighty Big Mac struck out, big time, on Capitol Hill.   
  
(Memo to self: do not vote for McGwire when he becomes eligible for the Baseball Hall of Fame.)

Each major league city has two sports writers with a Hall of Fame vote. When one of your home town guys votes no, youre sunk. Mark [McGwire ](https://www.hennessysview.com/?p=6)wont make the Hall of Fame, unless the Old-Timers committee is still around after McGwire dies from complications of steroid abuse.




Pete Rose is barred from the Hall because of his conduct AFTER his playing days. Mark McGwires set recordsnoble, towering recordsby cheating. His actions damaged the integrity of the game over a critical 8 year stretch. For that, he deserves a place in baseball history along side the Black Sox.
