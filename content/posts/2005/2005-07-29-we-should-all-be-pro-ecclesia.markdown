You might have noticed that I'm linking to [Jay Anderson's Pro Ecclesia](https://proecclesia.blogspot.com/) quite a bit lately.  You might think I'm selfishly skimming off his readers with cheap trackbacks, but that's not the case at all.  The fact is, Jay provides the best round-up of news interesting to Catholics and Christians I've found.  He provides full stories, great links, and pithy, on-the-nose comments.

If you're looking for great information on the state of God's world and its seeming indifference to Him, you'll find it at [Pro Ecclesia](https://proecclesia.blogspot.com/).
