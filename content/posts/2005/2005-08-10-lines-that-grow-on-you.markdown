In the past month, the hand of God has moved in my life so many times in so many wondeful ways.  Over and over, I find myself whispering parts of the Magnificat.  There is one stanza of that prayer that has worked its way into my very DNA:

 For He who is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is His name.

I think that's my new motto.

Quia fecit mihi magna qui potens est, et sanctum nomen ejus.

In society's jaded view, I probably have nothing to rejoice about.  But when the Lord our savior does things for us, society's blessing means nothing.

He who is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is his name.

Quia fecit mihi magna qui potens est, et sanctum nomen ejus.
