[Steven Taylor ](https://www.poliblogger.com/index.php?p=6314)beat me to [this story ](https://www.denverpost.com/Stories/0,1413,36~53~2733299,00.html)that the people who provided Churchill a podium from which to spew hatred, terrorism, venom, and lies is considering buying out his contract, as they would with a failing football coach. (But one whose players like to rape girls.) Read the rest on [Poliblog](https://poliblogger.com/).




UPDATE: [Ward Churchill assaults Denver news crew](https://treyjackson.typepad.com/junction/2005/02/rporter_questio.html) as they ask about his fake art. h/t [Glenn Reynolds](https://instapundit.com/archives/021404.php).
