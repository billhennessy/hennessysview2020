Judge George Greer rejected the Schindler's last appeal to save Terri.

From [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,151585,00.html):


> A state judge on Saturday rejected another attempt by Terri Schiavo's parents to reconnect her feeding tube, rejecting what the couple's lawyer described as their last chance to keep their severely brain-damaged daughter alive. 



The Schindlers said they will not appeal again.

Those who have sacrificed, prayed, e-mailed, blogged, hoped, and cried for Terri may feel defeated.  Don't.  Terri's final days gave many of us the chance to turn closer to God.  Perhaps what was her purpose.   If so, it is a noble one.

What others are saying today:
[Sheri ](https://straightupwsherri.blogspot.com/2005/03/bob-schindler-she-is-fighting-like.html)was among the first to blog.

[Jack Lewis](https://jacklewis.net/weblog/archives/2005/03/terri_schiavo_b_1.php) is rounding up blog reactions.

I'm trying to avoid recrimination, but [Beth blogs about ](https://bamapachyderm.com/archives/2005/03/26/yet-another-cause-for-reasonable-doubt/)Michael Schiavo's generous campaign contributions to Judge George Greer.

[Last night, I was full of hope](https://www.hennessysview.com/?p=650).

[Billmon ](https://billmon.org/archives/001773.html)gives us a good read on the religious battle that the Schiavo case evolved into.
