I have to agree with[ Ed Morrissey ](https://www.captainsquartersblog.com/mt/archives/004157.php)on this:  Governor Bush has done all he can do, and he must not violate the law to save Terri Schiavo.

That might sound callous, but staying within the law is now our last refuge.  As Thomas More told Will Roper in Robert Bolt's "[A Man for All Seasons](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/external-search?search-type=ss&tag=hennesssview-20&keyword=0679728228&index=books)":



> This country's planted thick with laws from coast to coast -- man's laws, not God's -- and if you cut them down -- and you're just the man to do it -- d'you really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then? Yes, I'd give the Devil benefit of law, for my own safety's sake. 



This page has argued for the Congress, the President, and the Governor to make extraordinary efforts to prevent the murder by dehydration of a mentally damaged human being.  I believe all parties have made that effort and have done so within the law.  I further believe that Judge Greer has operated outside the law.   But blatantly violating the court's order in this case will neither save Terri's life nor fix the extra-Constitutional judiciary that has grown up in America over the past 50 years.

Take More's advice, now, and hide in the thickets of the law.  Let the Devil look for us there where Daniel Webster can defend us.

Via [National Review ](https://www.nationalreview.com/thecorner/05_03_20_corner-archive.asp#059261)we find this [USA Today story ](https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-03-24-schiavo-money-cover_x.htm)on the Schinlders, the Schiavos, and the One Million Dollars.

For those hoping they are lucky enough to die of starvation and dehydration  (apparently that the preferred way to go for NYTimes folks), [read this first-hand account](https://wittingshire.blogspot.com/2005/03/thirst.html).
