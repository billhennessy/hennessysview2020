Suppose you have three sets of data: Customers, Orders, Products.




You want to present three dropdownlists--one for each set of data. When I select a Customer from list A, list is rebuilt with Orders for that customer, the first order is selected, and list C is updated with the Products for that order, the first Product selected.




Using ASP.NET postbacks is pretty straightforward, but it's also pretty ugly.

[I've taken his work and extended to achieve the solution descibed above](https://blog.billhennessy.com/forums/927/ShowPost.aspx).
