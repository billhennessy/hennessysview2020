Saint Maria Faustina Kowalska adored silence.  Only through her special relationship with Jesus Christ could she find the inner strength to pray, to contemplate, worship, and hear God, amid the din of her convent.  I can only imagine the cacophony of that house of nuns.

With Mothers Day commitments abound, I was reduced to attending 5:30 Mass tonight.  I lasted 10 minutes18 if you count the time before the Mass started.  During my eight minutes for reflection, I tried to pray against the blaring, bad rock music.  I failed.  I asked God for the grace to maintain inner silence despite the noise.  But my faith is not so strong as Faustinasor Faustinas din was significantly less than the audio horror show.

At 5:40, I walked out of the church, not in disgust or protest, but in failure.  Before me, God placed a huge challenge to my faith.  He surrounded me with the loudest of terrible music and asked me to pray through it.  I could not.  Forgive me, Lord, but I am still growing in faith.

I suppose its too much to ask the church to give us a few minutes of silence in which to pray, to prepare ourselves, before opening the church doors to a watered down version of pop music.  I suppose the church feels that performing really awful music attracts teenagers to Mass.  Lord, I pray not.  I pray, first, that the kids have an appreciation of good rock and rollgood enough that the abomination at Mass would cause them great distress.  Second, I pray that their faith is strong enough to sit in a church for 45 minutes and think about God, a difficult feat against the imposed temptation to think about how loud and terrible the music is.

If the kids go to 5:30 Mass to hear THAT, then I must say they suffer from a distorted understanding of God and a heretical disregard for music.
