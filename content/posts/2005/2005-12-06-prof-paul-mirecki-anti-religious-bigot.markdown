Okay, I can't claim credit for this research.  Jack Cashill earns the kudos for his December 1 commentary on [WorldNetDaily](https://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=47664).  As with pro-terrorist professor Ward Churchill, [Mirecki ](https://www.billhennessy.com/?p=886)has a long paper trail of opposing those with faith, particularly Catholics and Jews.  Here's an excerpt from Cashill's outstanding piece.



> 
In response to a SOMA communicant outraged that students were distributing free Bibles on campus, Mirecki told of how he had conceived an "anti-Bible tract" to counter the Christian presence. "I've made one already and can distribute copies to the damned if you'd all like to check it out."

Just last month, another student told Mirecki how "FREAKING ANNOYING" it was to be approached by a Bible distributor. "Yeah, I was offered one and asked the guy why he wanted the 'dark ages' to return," answered Mirecki. "He just smiled at me with that inane look of the "convinced."

Nor is it just "Fundies" who come in for the "Evil Dr. P's" abuse. Wrote Mirecki to a SOMA student on May 18, 2005, "I don't think most Catholics really know what they are supposed to believe, they just go home and use condoms and some of them beat their wives and husbands."

Mirecki confirmed another student's suspicions about Catholics, "Yup, its [sic] world domination they are after." And when a student described the ailing Pope John Paul II as a "a corpse in a funny hat wearing a dress," Mirecki responded, "I love it! I refer to him as J2P2 (John Paul II), like the Star Wars robot R2D2."

And as to Jews, on Jan. 15, 2003, when a student mocks "the Zionists who want to rebuild the temple and sacrifice red heifers; the joy of fundamentalism," Mirecki affirms him with a "Yeah." 



On the beating front, the only evidence that Professor Mirecki's views on religion were involved in the alleged battery is his comments to a newspaper.  The Lawrence, KS sheriff's office has not confirmed any of Professor Mirecki's claims as of this writing.  As far as we know, his alleged assailants were radical DemocratUnderground thugs furious that he asked KU to cancel his "Why I Hate God and His Followers" course.  (The[ Lawrence Journal-World](https://www2.ljworld.com/news/2005/dec/05/mirecki_hospitalized_after_beating/?breaking) is keeping tabs on the story.)

Also, for the moonbats so upset over this story that they skipped work today, a question:  If Mirecki is right, if there is no God, then what moral authority does government have to prevent or punish Mirecki's beating?
