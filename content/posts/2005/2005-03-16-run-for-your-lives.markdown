[Amazon ](https://www.amazon.com)is down! Been down since about 8:39 CST.




When Amazon crashed in 1999, it was BIG news. Oracle and Sun Solaris weren't playing well together. Sent shock waves through the tech world. I can't think of any major outages at the site since.




UPDATE: Maybe its my DNS server. Or maybe half the internet is down. I can get to [MSN ](https://www.msn.com)but not [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com). [CNN ](https://www.cnn.com)comes up. [USAToday ](https://www.usatoday.com)does not. [Michelle Malkin ](https://www.michellemalkin.com/)works.
