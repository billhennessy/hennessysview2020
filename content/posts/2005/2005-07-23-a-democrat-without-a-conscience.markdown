In the [Museum of Left-Wing Lunacy ](https://www.museumofleftwinglunacy.com/archives/2005/07/if_you_thought.html)we find a blood-boiling story of typical Democrat callous hatefulness.

Pennsylvania Lt. Governor Catherine Baker Knoll is the sort of thing one scrapes from the bottom of a shoe.  She crashed the funeral mass of fallen Marine Sgt. Joseph Goodrich to campaign for office and to chastise the family of the fallen hero, saying "our government opposes this war."



> She sat down next to a Goodrich family member and, during the distribution of communion, said, "Who are you?" Then she handed the family member one of her business cards, which Goodrich said she still has.



By her actions, Lt. Gov. Knoll demonstrated evil hatred for the Marine, committed psychological abuse on the family, and desecrated the Holy Communion.  She is very lucky that Marine was safely in heaven, or he'd have promptly put her safely in hell.

 [BlackFive ](https://www.blackfive.net/main/2005/07/lt_governor_cra.html)has a link to e-mail Pennsylvania governor Rendell.
The[ Pittsburgh Tribune-Review](https://pittsburghlive.com/x/tribune-review/trib/regional/s_352391.html) has a Sgt. Goodrich's story.
[Michelle Malkin](https://michellemalkin.com/archives/003089.htm) is rightly up in arms.
[Rhymes with Right](https://rhymeswithright.mu.nu/archives/106176.php) wants to begin impeachment campaign.  It has at least one supporter in Missouri.
A commenter at [Large Bill Pontificates](https://largebillpontificates.blogspot.com/2005/07/this-is-outrageous.html) makes the excellent point that the state of Pennsylvania is not free to hold an independent view on the war.

[Pittsburg Post-Gazette ](https://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05204/542520.stm)article that started it all.
