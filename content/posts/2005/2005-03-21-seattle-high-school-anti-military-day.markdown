A fine Marine has written a letter complaining of his treatment at a Seattle High School "Hate the US Military Day." (That's not what they called it, but that's what it was.

UPDATE: Here's my first e-mail these folks:


> I have read with interest the story of the sickening, un-American, anti-troop demonstration one of your high schools recently perpetrated. When I learned today that US Marine was invited to this affair in order to be ridiculed and lied about by brainless teachers and idiot students, I had to act. I demand an apology to service members of every branch and every war from each member of the school board and each faculty member of West Seattle High School. I will post that apology, with signatures, on my web site. Until I receive that apology, I will encourage each of my 4,000 readers to send each of you a daily e-mail demanding same.



UPDATE:  March 22 e-mail to the school board and West Seattle High School's principal:



> Folks,

I continue to hear from military veterans who are sickened by your political ambush the US Marine Major last week.  I hope you are hearing from them, as well.

I hope you will take this opportunity to denounce the travesty that occured in your schools last week so that we who have worn this great nation's uniform can move on.

Sincerely,

William T. Hennessy
