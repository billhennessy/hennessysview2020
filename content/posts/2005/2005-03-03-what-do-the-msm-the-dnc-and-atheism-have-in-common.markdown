Way too much to catalog here, but one big thing is--dying.




According to the [World Tribune](https://www.worldtribune.com/worldtribune/05/breaking2453432.91875.html), atheism is in decline around the world.

> John Updike's observation, "Among the repulsions of atheism for me has been is drastic uninterestingness as an intellectual position," appears to become common currency throughout much of the West. The Rev. Paul M. Zulehner, dean of Vienna University's divinity school and one of the world's most distinguished sociologists of religion, told UPI Tuesday: "True atheists in Europe have become an infinitesimally small group. There are not enough of them to be used for sociological research."
