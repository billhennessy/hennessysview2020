Nope, .....I really don't see a pattern here to justify profiling, do you?




So, to ensure we Americans never offend anyone, particularly fanatics intent on killing us, airport security screeners will no longer   
be allowed to profile certain people. They must conduct random searches of 80-year-old women, little kids, airline pilots with proper dentification, secret agents who are members of the President's security detail, 85-year old Congressmen with metal hips, and Medal of Honor winning and former Governor Joe Foss, but leave Muslim Males between the ages 17 and 40 alone because of profiling.
