Well, we know that the left opposes the death penalty for the likes of Dennis Rader, the BTK killer, but some do support capital punishment for political speech and activity. [Stephen Crockett ](https://magic-city-news.com/article_3206.shtml)wants murder Katherine Harris and Ken Blackwell because they're Republicans. Combine this with the DUer who wants to beat the crap out of the 9-year-old for Social Security reform, and you have the makings of a leftwing lynch mob.




But they're the compassionate ones. Rrrriiiigghhhhttt.
