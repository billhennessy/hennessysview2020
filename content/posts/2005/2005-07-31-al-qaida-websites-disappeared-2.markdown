Thanks to [Drudge](https://www.drudgereport.com/).

Israeli intelligence reports that the large network of al-Qaeda web sites, the organizations primary means of international communication, have been taken out of service.  The Israelis believe UK intelligence did the Lord's work on this case, reports the [Times of London](https://www.washingtontimes.com/op-ed/20050728-081354-1414r.htm).



> Over the past fortnight Israeli intelligence agents have noticed something distinctly odd happening on the internet. One by one, Al-Qaedas affiliated websites have vanished until only a handful remain, write Uzi Mahnaimi and Alex Pell. 



More power to Tony Blair.
