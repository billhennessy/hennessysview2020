Boy, something evil crawled up the wrong end of The Simpsons' writers and died. You get the feeling that they're pulling for Al Qaeda. The entire post game episode, promoted heavily for two weeks, was a mockery of everything good and decent. Anyone with mild religiosity advocates beating and killing.




Ah, well. They lost the biggest election of their putrid lives. I guess I should remember them in my prayers tonight. That'll piss 'em off.
