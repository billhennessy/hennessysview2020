There is nothing finer in life on this earth than to have a great advocate in heaven.  I seem to have one in Our Lady.  Never have I have fled to her protection, implored her help, or sought her intercession and was left unaided.

If you don't believe in the ability of saints in heaven to advocate on your behalf, do yourself a favor.  The next time you really need help, especially in your faith or in fighting temptation, give Jesus' mother a chance to help.  Jesus has a special love for His mother's petitions.  Let her present yours to Him as her own.  She will.  And you will receive an answer in accordance with His holy will.
