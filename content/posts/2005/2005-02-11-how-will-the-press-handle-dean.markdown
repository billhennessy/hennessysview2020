Reading the [AP story via Yahoo](https://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/ap/20050210/ap_on_re_us/democrats_chair_5) about Howard Dean's pending coronation as chairman of the DNC, my paranoia kicked in again. What if the press turns him into a folk hero--again?




I can see the MSM going berserk for the next two year. Everything the man says, does, and thinks broadcast live throughout the world as it happens. The liberal pundits will defend his frequent bouts of stupidity and insanity as demonstrative of his deep intellect. "You red staters just aren't equipped with the mental prowess to capture his deep and transient meanings," they'll assure us. "But Howard Dean is moving the party in the right direction."




You know what they say about a lie repeated often enough. Well, that's what the MSM does best. Just ask Dan Rather.
