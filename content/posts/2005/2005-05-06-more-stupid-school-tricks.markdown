A high school in Columbus, GA suspended a 17-year-old student for taking a cell phone call from his mother who is serving our country in Iraq.



> The confrontation Wednesday began after the 17-year-old junior got a call at lunchtime from his mother, Sgt. 1st Class Monique Bates, who left in January for a one-year tour with the 203rd Forward Support Battalion.

Spencer High School pats itself on the back for not having the kid arrested.  Yes, they considered calling the cops on him.

Considering the fact that one can find a story on un-Americanism praticed by some educator every day of the week, perhaps we need to overhaul the education industry.
