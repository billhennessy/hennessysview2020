I wish I could give the details, but that would cause problems.  Suffice it to say that two weeks ago, something my wife and I had been praying hard for seemed to have been placed out of reach.  If that was God's answer to our prayers, it was a resounding "Get lost."

Thankfully, though, we didn't stop.  I went straight to the perpetual adoration chapel and knelt before the exposed Body of Christ for an hour and a half.  Then I drove and prayed.  Then I repeated that process.  I finished a novena and dropped the request from my prayers, except for a short daily petition.  The doxology of the Chaplet of Divine Mercy must be applied:  Jesus, I trust  in you.

It now appears that God's "no" was something more like man's delay--a speed bump.  God answered our prayers.  I do not know why, though.  My wife might be an angel, but I am about as worthy as cut golf ball.  I don't deserve His ear, much less His favors.   I can only assume that because I am so wretched and weak, God figures he has something to work with.  Perhaps He likes the challenge.

_My soul magnifies the Lord,
And my spirit rejoices in God my Savior.
For He has regarded the low estate of His handmaiden,
For behold, henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.
For He who is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is His name. And His mercy is on those who fear Him from generation to generation.
He has shown strength with His arm:
He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.
He has put down the mighty from their thrones,
and exalted those of low degree.
He has filled the hungry with good things;
and the rich He has sent empty away.
He has helped His servant Israel, in remembrance of His mercy;
As He spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to His posterity forever._

Not that anyone will ever call me blessed--nor a handmaiden--but I kind of know how Our Lady was feeling when she recited the above to Elizabeth.
