Yes, there are many other things to write about.  My move to Ballwin, Missouri has interrupted both my observations of the world at large and my commenting on them.  Still, a singularly inspiring photo caught my eye:

The evil, hate-mongering Benedict XVI plays nice with the new Palestinian leader. When I was a cynical young man, I'd have made good humor about this.  Today, though, and only by God's beneficence, I see nothing but hope.  Nothing but hope.  Hope eternal, in God, through Christ His son, our Lord.  Amen.
