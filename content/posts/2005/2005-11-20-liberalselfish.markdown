The correlation between liberalism and selfishness is too easy to make.  Atheistic liberalism gives selfishness a whole new dimension.  But liberals, who in their selfishness consider themselves the epitome of compassion, say you can't measure compassion.

I utterly refute that idiot sentiment.  And it is nothing more than mere sentiment.

Via [FoxNews.com](https://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,176163,00.html), we learn that folks in  liberal states spend their money almost exclusively on themselves, while "Bible belt" people  spend money on those who need help.

Surprise, surprise.

A modern day Robin Hood would steal from the left and give the poor.
