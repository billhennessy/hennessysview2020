I just learned how much money I'm flushing down the toilet by participating the [Social Security scam](https://www.heritage.org/research/features/socialsecurity/):

> You can expect to pay $383,219 in Social Security taxes over your
working life for retirement and survivors benefits. For those taxes,
you can expect to receive $2,525 a month in Social Security retirement
benefits. Your rate of return under today's Social Security is 0.03%.   
  
However,
if you had been able to invest all of your Social Security taxes in a
Personal Retirement Account (PRA), you would have had a total of
$1,246,148 when you retired. Your monthly benefits would have been
$10,151. You lost $7,626 a month.
