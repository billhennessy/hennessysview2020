The hatred and anger of those still think Stalin a role model of good national governance earns its own blog entry. Again, I wish I could afford to buy these folks an old, polluting car and a good air-tight garage. They really seem to have exhausted the joy of living.

And the Kurds are going to want to separate. That's even better.

I hear that the Iraqis are really electing "a process" rather than candidates to represent them. That's the latest spin on this lotto draw for a "representative" government. Disgusting.

> "Turnout" is typically a measure of the number of registered voters who show up to vote. Since this is a standalone two-phase "election," it's equivalent to measuring how many people at a restaurant have a main course after their appetizer and calling it 'repeat customers'. There's not a single person who registered who didn't do so with the intention of voting in this one election. It's not at all like any other country where longtime already-registered voters 'turnout'. (If we were to measure the number of people who voted among those who registered within 2 months of an election, we'd probably get "turnout" near 80-90%.)

That's the way they see it, folks. I'm not making this up
