The [Miami-Herald ](https://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/11233240.htm)reports that Florida Governor Jeb Bush sent a team of state workers to take custody of Terri Schievo last week, nearly resulting in a confrontation between those workers and police.



> Hours after a judge ordered that Terri Schiavo was not to be removed from her hospice, a team of state agents were en route to seize her and have her feeding tube reinserted -- but they stopped short when local police told them they would enforce the judge's order, The Herald has learned.

Agents of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement told police in Pinellas Park, the small town where Schiavo lies at Hospice Woodside, on Thursday that they were on the way to take her to a hospital to resume her feeding.

In the end, the squad from the FDLE and the Department of Children & Families backed down, apparently concerned about confronting local police outside the hospice.




It's too bad they backed down, really.  At the time, the political ramifications would have been much milder.

BTW, David Boies, the Al Gore election lawyer, is making great arguments for the Schindlers on Scarborogh Country on [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com).
