A seemingly drunk Ward Churchill is spewing bizarre conspiracy theories on C-SPAN, taped March 25, 2005.  He claims that 6 in 10 New Yorkers believe that September 11 was perpetrated by the US Government.  He went on to say that he won't give "white guys" credit for the attacks until he has proof.

He's having a very difficult time reading the questions.

"Is capitalism bad?"  (chuckles from audience)

"Okay, you heard it here first:  capitalism is bad."

So what's the alternative?

"Something that's held up the test of time and not something that some genius white guy who thought it up."

This guy is a power-hungry meglomaniac bent on destroying everything that he believes bested him.  Now that academia has turned on him, it has become his latest target.

Question:  "What gets you up in the morning?"

Churchill:   "Usually a desire to urinate."

Charming.

Colorado must be soooooo proud.
