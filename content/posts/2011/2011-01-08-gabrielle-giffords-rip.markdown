Like all decent people, I am disgusted to hear the sad news out of Tucson, AZ: Rep. [Gabrielle Giffords (D-AZ) was shot and killed](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/01/08/arizona-congresswoman-reportedly-shot-public-event/) along with four others today. Twelve were shot altogether. The murderer was apprehended by heroic bystanders and is in custody. 

 

Not sure of the young murderer’s motives. I’m sure they weren’t worth killing or dying for. Except to him.

 

Please prayer for the souls of the faithful departed, the well-being of their families, the quick recovery of the wounded, and the delivery of justice. 

 

UPDATE: It gets worse. A small child is among the dead.

 

And hatemongers at Daily Kos wasted no time in blaming Sarah Palin according to [blogger Joel Achenbach at WaPo](https://voices.washingtonpost.com/achenblog/2011/01/gabrielle_giffords.html).

 

UPDATE 2: Rep. [Giffords reportedly in surgery](https://www.kpho.com/news/26411850/detail.html). Our prayer are with her. 

 

Leftists like Yglesias, Kos, and HuffPo continue to blame tea party, Breitbart, and Sarah Palin. Disgusting, sick, vile. Here’s an example from HuffPo:

Meanwhile, DailyKos has [deleted a damning post](https://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2011/1/6/933828/-My-CongressWOMAN-voted-against-Nancy-Pelosi!-And-is-now-DEAD-to-me!) from a leftist angry at Giffords for voting AGAINST Nancy Pelosi. But [Jim Treacher](https://twitpic.com/photos/jtLOL) grabbed a screen shot before Kos could rewrite history.
