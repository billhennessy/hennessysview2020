Last week, the Illinois legislature passed a massive income tax increase on individuals and businesses.  Overall, it represents about a 67 percent income tax increase.

In response, neighboring [states of Wisconsin and Indiana](https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110113/ap_on_re_us/us_broken_budgets_battling_for_business) have wisely mounted massive campaigns to suck businesses and people out of Illinois.  Even New Jersey’s fabulous governor, [Chris Christie, plans to fish the Land o’ Lincoln](https://hotair.com/greenroom/archives/2011/01/14/chris-christie-to-pluck-business-from-illinois/) for some business transplants.

One state bordering Illinois has been notoriously silent.  Missouri Governor Jay Nixon has done _nothing_ to steal business and residents away from Illinois.

Is Nixon being lazy?  Or is he just being a good Democrat?

While we’re at it, why isn’t St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay beating the bushes on the East Side?  The city needs business and people desperately, but Slay has been as silent as Nixon.

Look, people, I realize that we have a lot of friends in Illinois.  My wife is from GC.  Most of her family lives in Madison County.  But [businesses and workers are going to flee to the state](https://hotair.com/greenroom/archives/2011/01/12/illinois-taxing-its-way-to-prosperity/).  Illinois dropped from the 23rd best tax state to the 36th in one step.  With Democrats in charge of the legislature and the governorship, this increase is only the beginning.  Illinois taxes will rise until the people in Illinois elect tax cutting budget hawks.

In the meantime, Jay Nixon has an obligation to put Missouri’s economy ahead of Democrat party loyalties.  Missouri needs to follow the leads of Indiana, Wisconsin, and New Jersey by campaigning for fleeing Illinois businesses and people.

*UPDATE* Over on United for Missouri, [Emily Iles explains the extraordinary dangers to Illinois' economy](https://www.unitedformissouri.org/statewide/illinois-jumps-shark-income-tax/) this tax hike poses.
