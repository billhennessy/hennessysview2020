Pro-Western governments in these countries have fallen to anti-American forces or diminished their support for the US since Barack Obama became president.

 

    * Lebanon** Jordan** Yemen** Qatar** Egypt** Turkey  

Obama’s campaign promise to restore respect for America around the world is a joke. A cruel and dangerous joke. Our enemies see Obama’s weakness as American weakness. As they did during Jimmy Carter’s failed presidency, those enemies are advancing. 

 

The next president will have more than a financial catastrophe to fix.
