](https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/UofMCommie.png)The University of Missouri St. Louis uses tax dollars to provide a recruiting station for the Communist Party USA—an organization whose purpose is to shred the United States Constitution.

[UMSL Student Philip Christofanelli](https://biggovernment.com/pchristofanelli/2011/05/09/introduction-to-labor-studies-my-first-hand-account/) heroically chronicles the remarkable Marxist indoctrination known as “Introduction to Labor Studies” on BigGovernment.com.  I’ll give you a taste:



> Prof. Giljum then introduced Tony Pecinovsky, a local organizer for the Communist Party, who proceeded to speak to us for two hours about the beliefs of the Communist Party and the benefits of membership.  That’s right–the Communist Party was allowed two hours of publicly subsidized class time to recruit. Thank you, Missouri taxpayers!



We’ve listened to the lies of UMSL and UMKC Provosts Glen Hahn and Gail Hackett for two weeks as they tried to defend the Marxist indoc camps they run with your money.

**ENOUGH**.

We’re read Tim Baker’s pack of lies in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Baker employed the subtle lie of “academic freedom,” treating that age-old communist tool as if it were on the tablets God gave Moses. (Read _God and Man at Yale_ by William F. Buckley Jr. for more on academic freedom.)

**ENOUGH**.

We’ve listened to the whining lies of Don Giljum, the violent sabotage guru whose primary mission in the Labor Studies class seems to be destruction of the American economy.  The same Don Giljum who launched an unprovoked violent attack on Adam Sharp only to be coddled by UMSL Provost Glen Hahn who seized the evidence in the case.

**ENOUGH**!!!!

It’s time for Hahn, Hackett, and Ancel to resign or be fired.

It’s time the Missouri Legislature to stand up to communist indoctrination in the state university system. Where the hell are you, Steve Tilley?

It’s time to reform the U of M system or end public funding.
