I’ve written about this before. 

The problem with traffic signals is that they make all of the problems they’re designed to solve worse. By “all the problems” I mean:   * Pollution    * Congestion    * Deaths    * Accidents    * Speed of Transit    * Risk to pedestrians (except those with certain disabilities)

Banning red light cameras is a great first step, but the ultimate goal should be elimination of traffic lights altogether.

Turning the lights off worked.    * Less pollution    * Fewer accidents (cars and pedestrians)    * Less congestion    * Shorter commutes    * Safer roads    * Happier people    * Up to 20 percent better fuel economy
