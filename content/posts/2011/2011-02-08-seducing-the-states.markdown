You can’t call yourself a conservative and ask for education money from Washington.

 

Republicans dominate both houses of the Missouri legislature. You’d think they’d act like republicans (lower case). But when it comes to education bribes from Washington, many of our Republican legislators show little resistance to political seduction. We can help them.

 

On BigGovernment. com, [Bob McCarty highlights the hypocrisy](https://biggovernment.com/bmccarty/2011/02/05/why-are-so-many-states-embracing-federal-control-of-education-while-siding-against-obamacare/) of blasting ObamaCare from one side of the mouth while begging for federal cash out of the other. He points to a [Heritage Foundation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DOCH1YT6Uk) that features our own [education watch dog Gretchen Logue](https://www.missourieducationwatchdog.com/).

 

[Ronald Reagan never got around to dismantling the Department of Education](https://www.wnd.com/index.php?pageId=27895). In the year of his 100th birthday, let’s honor him by resisting the seduction of Washington bribes. The Constitution is clearly silent on the issue, which means the 10th Amendment prohibits appropriations for local schools.

 

**Here’s What You Can Do**

 

Contact your Missouri State Legislators today and ask them to send Arne Duncan’s bribe back to DC. Call or email your Missouri [State Rep](https://www.senate.mo.gov/llookup/leg_lookup.aspx). and [Senator](https://www.senate.mo.gov/11info/senalpha.htm). Tell them to send DC's Education Bribe back where it came from.

 

Senators Lembke and Nieves are trying to #senditback. And they need our help.

 

Call or email now.

 

**Then Do One More Thing**

 

In addition to calling or writing, please do the following:

**Don't Listen to the Liberal Lies**  

If Missouri takes Arne Duncan's bribe, it will simply INCREASE general spending, not education spending. That's just the way government works.

 

By returning this bribe (and its burdensome handcuffs), we'll send a message--and instill fiscal responsiblity in both Jeff City and Washington.

 

Please call your state [Representative ](https://www.senate.mo.gov/llookup/leg_lookup.aspx)and [Senator](https://www.senate.mo.gov/11info/senalpha.htm) today.
