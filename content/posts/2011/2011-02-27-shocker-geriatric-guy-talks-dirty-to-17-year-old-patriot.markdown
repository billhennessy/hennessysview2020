In this [disturbing video](https://www.poedpatriot.com/2011/02/high-school-student-hands-out.html), an old union guy vividly describes tea-bagging to a 17-year-old high schooler. The reason? The kid had the audacity to hand out free US Constitutions.

 

As you’ll see in the [video from P/Oed Patriot](https://www.poedpatriot.com/2011/02/high-school-student-hands-out.html) and [Sharp Elbows](https://sharpelbowsstl.blogspot.com/), the site of the Constitution at a union rally is like a crucifix and a pound of garlic in a vampire den. You can actually watch as the document’s presence weakens the aging leftists. They age before your eyes.

Shocking.

 

The young man passing out Constitutions consented to the release of this video.

Here are full-on headshots of the pervert and his defender:
