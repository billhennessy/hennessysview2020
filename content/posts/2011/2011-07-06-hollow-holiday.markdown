July 4, 2011, felt hollow, like celebrating the birthday of someone deceased. 

Independence Day celebrates the birth of an idea: that people create governments and empower them, not the other way around. 

Do we still believe that?

Yes, I still believe that. Morally, at least. And you probably do, too. 

Does America still believe that government derives its just powers from the consent of the governed? Or do we, as a nation, believe that government has a monopoly on liberty and dispenses it at its will? 

As Harvard University pointed out, [people who vote for the Democrat party](https://hennessysview.com/limited-government/thank-you-harvard/) no longer believe what the founders believed. **The Democratic party believes that the federal government owns liberty; you and I must apply for our freedoms. There is no guarantee.** 

Do you realize how profound that is? 

Once upon a time, we learned that both parties wanted the same end via different means. But that’s no longer true. Now, one party and many independents still believe that people are bigger than government. But **our government is in the hands of politicians, bureaucrats, and unions who believe that we are their servants**. 

At some point, majority or minority becomes irrelevant. A dictatorial or oligarchical tyranny won’t allow a mere majority to end its rule. 

How close are we to that grim eventuality? Or have we crossed the line?

**On August 4, 2011, St. Louis Tea Party Coalition will rally in Kiener Plaza** for the third time. We come together in celebration of Calvin Coolidge’s inauguration, the USS Nautilus’s first voyage under the North Pole, and Christopher Columbus’s launch for the New World which all occurred on August 3. It’s also Barack Obama’s birthday. 

**Our mission is to restore the meaning of Independence Day**. Our purpose is to re-energize the idea of liberty in our land. Our plan is to hold a Tea Party in abject _defiance_ of Barack Obama’s power trip. 

You won’t be alone.
