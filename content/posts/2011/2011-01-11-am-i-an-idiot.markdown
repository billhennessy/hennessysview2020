For most of my life I was naïve.  I think.

I thought that most people who voted for larger government, higher taxes, tighter regulation, and limits on speech, religion, and assembly, were misguided.

I’ve always known and acknowledged that the people who advocated and plotted to concentrate power in the hands of a few were wicked creatures.  I never hesitated to attack them head-on.

But the others.  The others I sometimes pitied. Other times I belittled.  Other times I simply giggled at them.

After the center-left’s response to Tucson, I think I might have been wrong.  There might not be many “good” liberals.  Maybe most on the center-left are rotten, power-hungry, freedom-hating, murder-using slime.

Please show me I’m wrong. Don’t bother telling me, because I don’t believe a one of you. Show me.

The liberal-progressive-left world has demonstrated the worst of humanness this week.  It’ll take a lot to convince me you haven’t sold your souls.
