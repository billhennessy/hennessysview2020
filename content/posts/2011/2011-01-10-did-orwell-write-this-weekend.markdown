Democrats—from Jane Fonda to Senator Bob Brady of Pennsylvania—are pushing to ban words, phrases, and images they don’t like, as [P/Od Patriot points out](https://www.poedpatriot.com/2011/01/attack-on-free-speech-begins-democrat.html).

 

Yes, we are living in very dangerous times. And the danger comes almost exclusively from the left.

 

    * Democrat [McCaskill calls for Americans to take up arms](https://gatewaypundit.rightnetwork.com/2010/12/claire-mccaskill-promotes-violence-if-dems-dont-get-their-historic-tax-hikes-it-really-is-time-for-americans-to-take-up-pitchforks-video/) if Democrat tax increase fails. (It did. And Gabrielle Giffords helped it fail.)** Democrat [Joe Biden threatened to strangle Republicans](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/10/06/biden-says-hell-strangle-republicans/) if they didn’t accede to his wishes.** Democrat [Frances Fox Piven called for a violent overthrow](https://www.theblaze.com/stories/frances-fox-piven-rings-in-the-new-year-by-calling-for-violent-revolution/) of the US systems.** Democrats . . . love to [call for violence against Americans](https://townhall.com/columnists/JohnHawkins/2010/03/30/violent_liberal_hate_rhetoric_fifteen_quotes/page/full/).  

The White House clearly was prepared for this. They cared not who was the victim or the perp. They simply needed a [crime to justify their assault on the first two amendments](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/01/08/report-obama-administration-plans-create-internet-id-americans/) to the Constitution. 

 

Brooks Bayne [points out the filth of the left](https://thegraph.com/2011/01/leftists-take-to-twitter-to-blamethreaten-beck-palin-and-tea-party-for-az-shooting/). Even Orwell’s pigs showed more decency and character than these modern liberals.
