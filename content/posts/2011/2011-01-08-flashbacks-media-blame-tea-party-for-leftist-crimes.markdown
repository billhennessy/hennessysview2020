The most often repeated story is not the reluctant hero or the hero who wants to get home. Nor is it about a mother’s love. 

 

The ultimate archetypical story line is:

 

LIBERAL PRESS ERRONEOUSLY BLAMES TEA PARTY FOR LEFTIST CRIMES

 

As [Jarod Lee Loughner’s political bent](https://hennessysview.com/2011/01/08/alleged-giffords-shooter-jared-loughner-leaves-video/) emerges, we see the same, predictable story playing out:

 

    1. A horrific crime takes place.*2. Leftist bloggers like Markos Moulitsas blame conservatives.*3. CNN, New York Times, Washinton Post, etc., repeat the libelous allegations.*4. Fact emerge proving Markos, CNN, etc., a bunch of cowardly liars.*5. Liberals erase their libelous stories.  

Here’s a few more examples of liberal media lies just from the past two years.

 

    * Remember the [Carnahan Campaign office “fire bombing](https://gatewaypundit.rightnetwork.com/2010/08/vandal-who-firebombed-carnahans-office-identified-hes-a-dem-operative-disgruntled-employee/)” blamed on Tea Party? Turns out the suspect was a former Carnahan campaign staffer.** Remember the [Discovery Channel Hostage Taker](https://www.businessinsider.com/discovery-channel-hostage-taker-demands-2010-9) whom the media called a Tea Partier? Turns out he was an Al Gore, left-wing, maggot-infested, environmentalist wacko.** Remember the Denver [Democratic HQ vandalism blamed on Tea Partiers](https://www.thedenverchannel.com/politics/20548292/detail.html)? Turns out it was Democratic party employees.   

If you can think of more similar cases, please post them in the comments.
