I’m getting a lot of requests to pump news about Claire McCaskill’s comments to Democrats. According to Brian R. Hook of Missouri Watchdog, [McCaskill gave Democrats a set of instructions](https://missouri.watchdog.org/12482/mccaskill-to-democrats-its-time-for-us-to-fight/?utm_source=MO_Subscriptions&utm_campaign=91a9ee8b21-Questionable_Welfare_Payments&utm_medium=email) very similar to those I usually give at the end of Tea Party rallies. (Only Claire’s instructions seem a bit less human than mine.)

 

Some national political scientists believe McCaskill’s Senate seat is one of the most vulnerable in 2012.

 

Republicans Sarah Steelman and [Ed Martin](https://edmartinformissouri.com/) Jr., who came within an eyelash of upsetting Russ Carnahan in last year’s race for Missouri’s 3rd US Congressional District, have announced their candidacies for the right to oppose McCaskill.

 

A primary challenge for McCaskill is not out of the question, but no Democrats have offered to challenge McCaskill so far.
