](https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/donut-cushion-for-coccyx.jpg)Dana Loesch has been plagued with a perstistent cold. Yesterday, her stairs leapt up and kicked her in the . . . 

 

Turns out to be a fractured coccyx (aka, tailbone).

 

We feel terrible that Dana had this tale to share with the world, but we congratulate ourselves for limiting the number of cheap jokes.

 

Certainly, we pray for minimal pain and minimal recovery time.
