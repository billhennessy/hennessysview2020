For decades, now, public sector unions have imposed onerous tax increases and service cuts on the net tax payers of many states. Wisconsin being among the worst. 

 

What do I mean by that?

 

Look at what’s going on in Wisconsin. The people who represent the net tax payers—those who pay more in taxes to the state than they receive in salary—are being vilified, harassed, threatened, and assaulted by the net tax takers—those receive more in state wages than they pay in state taxes. In fact, the net takers have shut down Wisconsin’ legislature with the help of 14 cowardly state senators.

 

What the Wisconsin unions want to keep is the power to impose any taxes they want on the people of Wisconsin through collective bargaining. That’s right, state employee unions have the power to tax the people. 

 

Suppose Wisconsin set a tax rate of 8 percent. Then [AFSCME (NSFW)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3mw49mk_x0) goes on strike demanding a 20 percent wage increase and a 5 percent workforce increase. To prevent chaos, the state grants the concession. Taxes must go up or non AFSCME services must go down.

 

But non-AFSCME services are likely covered under some other union’s contract. So the state has to raise taxes now, or borrow money now and raise taxes later. 

 

Either way, unelected union representatives have imposed a tax on the people. 

 

Letting unions determine a state’s tax policy is like letting a 16-year-old have a 12-pack of Budweiser and the car keys.
