[![DRUDGE REPORT 2011®](https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/DRUDGEREPORT2011.png)
](https://drudgereport.com) The federal budget [deficit in the month of February 2011](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/mar/7/government-posts-biggest-monthly-deficit-ever/) exceeds the deficit for [all of 2007](https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2007/10/05/deficit-for-fiscal-2007-slides/) by 40 percent. 

Simply staggering.

Yet Senate Democrats refuse to cut more than a paltry $6 billion. They refuse because they seem bent on collapsing the American system – the economy, the government, and the people themselves.

But at least the Obama administration stands by with its arms folded as [gasoline prices skyrocket at the their fastest pace in history](https://edition.cnn.com/2011/TRAVEL/03/06/gas.prices/).
