Look, folks, let’s remember who’s on whose side. 

Dana Loesch is a champion of liberty, the conservative grassroots, and everything else we stand for. And she’s a great friend to me, to the Tea Party, and, in a sense, to all of us. She’s elevated this movement locally and nationally like no one else. You wouldn’t be reading this post if not for her. 

I am so sorry that my piece from last night raised tempers. I tried to be wry and sarcastic, not angry. I guess I failed. Please forgive me. 

I am very sorry to Dana Loesch. I don’t know why some on our side are questioning her commitments to limited government, low taxes, fiscal responsibility, and national defense. I won’t elevate the accusations by repeating them, but I will say this: if it’s true of Dana, it’s true of me. 

And learn from my mistakes. [I hurt a friend last night](https://hennessysview.com/living/let-me-apologize/) by not thinking before posting. Avoid that pain. It helps no one.
