According to an internal Department of Homeland Security memo, Jarod Lee Loughner’s mother “works for Pima County Board of Supervisors.”

 

In the memo, [obtained by Fox News and posted on Greta Van Susteren’s blog](https://gretawire.blogs.foxnews.com/latest-on-shooting-of-congresswoman-giffords-motivation-anti-semitic-and-she-was-the-target/), the DHS agent openly speculates about undue internal influence. That’s because [Loughner’s arrests don’t all end](https://atlasshrugs2000.typepad.com/atlas_shrugs/2011/01/arizona-shooter-loughner-has-gun-despite-criminal-record.html) with reasonable closure, if you will.

 

Here’s exactly what the DHS report says:

 

>   
> 
> suspect’s mother works for the Pima County Board of Supervisors* the suspect has multiple arrests ... But no criminal record? Intervention by someone?
> 
> 

 

It’s not unreasonable to assume that that “someone” is Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik.

 

On Saturday evening, [Dupnik took to the airwaves to create a sensation](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/01/10/dupnik-friends-critics-remarks-arizona-shooting/). He accused the people of Arizona, talk radio, Sharon Angle, Sarah Palin, and the tea party of complicity in murder, effectively. The sheriff did so without evidence.

 

If [Dupnik was invol](https://thechollajumps.wordpress.com/2011/01/09/jared-loughner-is-a-product-of-sheriff-dupniks-office/)ved in springing Loughner after one of the murderer’s many arrests, then Dupnik had strong motive to manufacture a bogeyman. If [Dupnik helped keep Loughner stay out of the state psych system](https://www.redstate.com/moe_lane/2011/01/10/did-dupnik-dismiss-loughner-threat/), then his motive doubles. There’s [mounting evidence](https://gatewaypundit.rightnetwork.com/2011/01/report-sheriff-knew-about-loughners-actions-previous-threats-failed-to-act/) that [Dupnik is guilty of both](https://extranosalley.com/?p=8731). 

 

We already know that [Dupnik refused to uphold Arizona’s SB1070](https://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2010/04/29/2010-04-29_arizona_sheriff_clarence_dupnik_refuses_to_enforce_states_new_racist_immigration.html). We already know that he holds the people of [Arizona in the highest contempt](https://scaredmonkeys.com/2011/01/09/pima-county-sheriff-clarence-dupnik-blames-arizonas-%E2%80%9Cprejudice-bigotry%E2%80%9D-for-shooting-of-u-s-rep-giffords-by-jared-lee-loughner/). A law enforcement officer who despises the people he’s sworn to protect and who refuses to enforce the law he’s sworn to uphold is unfit for office.

 

If I were Arizona’s Attorney General, I’d be asking putting together a case for some warrants. 

 

But, as Dennis Miller would say, that’s just my opinion; I could be wrong.
