Obama’s friends in the public-sector unions stage embarrassing rallies to demand more, More, MORE of other people’s money. 

 

These aren’t unions that represent people who work in mines and factories. No, these are unions representing people who live off your and my tax dollars. (BTW,the military doesn’t have a union.)

 

So let’s see . . . The government does a bunch of stuff we don’t want them to do. The people who did it get paid twice as much as the people who pay them. And these people who make double our salaries who do stuff we ask them to stop are striking and vandalizing cities because they’re afraid they might be asked to live a little more like the rest of us. 

 

I say it’s time to heed [Franklin Roosevelt’s grim warning](https://respublica.typepad.com/respublica/2011/02/fdr-on-public-sector-unions.html) about the evils of [public-sector unions](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2011/02/19/the_ghost_of_fdr_is_smiling_on_wisconsins_governor_108962.html).

Yes, public workers may demand fair treatment, wrote Roosevelt. But, he wrote, "I want to emphasize my conviction that militant tactics have no place" in the public sector. "A strike of public employees manifests nothing less than an intent on their part to prevent or obstruct the operations of Government."

It’s time to eliminate collective bargaining for government workers.
