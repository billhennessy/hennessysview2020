You might have heard that Jefferson County Council was one of the happiest stories emerging from the 2010 election.

Well, some of the conservative champions who led the crusade to capture the council want to help more citizens become political leaders.

On Saturday, September 24, you can help.  You can help while having blast of a good time in Crystal City.

Events all day long, including live music in the caverns from 7 to 9 pm.

Make a day of it, and help bring some new blood to office in Jefferson County.
