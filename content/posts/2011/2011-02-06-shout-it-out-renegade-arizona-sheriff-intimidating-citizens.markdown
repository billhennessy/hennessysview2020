The [incompetent Sheriff Dupnik of Pima County Arizona](https://hennessysview.com/crime/sheriff-dupniks-culpability/) has intimidated speakers in an attempt to shut down the Tucson Tea Party.

](https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/clarence-dupnik.jpg)Now, Tucson’s asking for our help. [Jennifer Humphries wrote](https://gatewaypundit.rightnetwork.com/2011/02/the-tuscon-tea-party-needs-your-help-local-authorities-trying-to-silence-them/) to [Gateway Pundit](https://gatewaypundit.rightnetwork.com/) Jim Hoft. She asked Jim of his help defending the First Amendment rights of the people of Tucson. Those rights are under assault from an incompetent and irresponsible sheriff who has now turned to intimidation to silence dissent. 

 

I don’t know if Ms. Humphries would want me, but I’d be honored to speak in Tucson on April 30. I’d be honored to defy the Sheriff’s attempts to quash free speech in his county. And I’d love to see a swarm of folks from Missouri and Illinois fill the arena for that showdown.

 

**What You Can Do**

 

1. Make plans, if you can, to attend the Tucson Tea Party, April 30, 2011

 

2. [Donate to the Tucson Tea Party](https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_flow&SESSION=-_uW1COTZXJVkexOGwLWwXEo6YT3jUctZWO4SoyuwwysKNOQntROpbq5mg0&dispatch=5885d80a13c0db1f8e263663d3faee8df1d2b5c147af55b8d54f2944c97d2a2a)

 

3. Ask members of U.S. [House](https://judiciary.house.gov/) and Senate committees on Judiciary and [Civil Rights](https://judiciary.house.gov/about/subconstitution.html) to investigate Department of Justice’s involvement in political intimidation. 

 

When the Tea Party launched, its first theme was “Repeal the Pork or Retire.” We retired a lot of them in 2010, but we have a long way to go. 

 

Keep up the fight!

 

*UPDATE*

 

I sent a short questionnaire to Sheriff Clarence:

 

>   
> 
> I have received reports that your office has intimidated speakers scheduled to speak at events sponsored by Tucson Tea Party. 
> 
>    
> 
> 1. Do you deny this charge?
> 
>    
> 
> 2. Will you attempt to intimidate me from speaking in Tucson at a Tea Party event?
> 
> 

 

While we await his reply, let’s have a sing-along:

 

_Sheriff don’t like it*
__Rock the county,*
Rock the county._
