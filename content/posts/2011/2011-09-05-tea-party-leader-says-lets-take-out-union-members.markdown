> We got to keep an eye on the battle that we face: The war on Tea Partiers. And you see it everywhere, it is the Unions. And you know, there is only one way to beat and win that war. **The one thing about Tea Party people is we like a good fight.** And you know what? They've got a war, they got a war with us and there's only going to be one winner. It's going to be the Tea Partiers of Missouri, and America. We're going to win that war.





> Rick Santelli, this is your army. We are ready to march. **Let's take these son of bitches out** and give America back to an America where we belong!



Did I say “Tea Party Leader's message?” Sorry. I meant to say that was a paraphrasing of [Jimmy Hoffa’s message to his Teamsters](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2011/09/05/jimmy_hoffa_at_obama_event_on_gop_lets_take_these_son_of_bitches_out.html). Hoffa introduced President Barack Obama. That’s part of Obama’s new civil tone.

I swapped Tea Party and Tea Partiers with union and workers.  Had I or any Tea Partier actually said those words, the FBI would already be at our doors. But union crooks get applause from the President for calling for violence.

Isn’t it odd that a man whose father so famously failed at violence as a political tactic would use violence to get his (very unpopular) way?

**UPDATE** [St. Louis Tea Party Coalition releases official response to Teamster Boss](https://stlouisteaparty.com/2011/09/05/press-release-response-to-jimmy-hoffas-call-for-war/) Jimmy Hoffa's call for war on the Tea Party.
