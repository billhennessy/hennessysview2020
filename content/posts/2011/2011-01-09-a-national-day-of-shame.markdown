It’s bad enough that five people died, including a wonderful nine-year-old girl.

It’s bad enough that a dozen or more people were shot.

It’s bad enough that a deranged man attacked our American system.

But America’s liberal elite turned the tragedy into a national day of shame.  They accomplished this by callously and capriciously blaming innocent political opponents for the violence.  When confronted with facts to the contrary, liberals, including [Paul Krugman](https://gatewaypundit.rightnetwork.com/2011/01/disgrace-krugman-blames-gop-for-attempted-assassination-today-before-we-found-out-hes-a-leftwinger/), CBS News, the New York Times, CNN, MSNBC, Jane Fonda, Sheriff [Dupnick of Pima County Arizona](https://gatewaypundit.rightnetwork.com/2011/01/pima-county-az-sheriff-clarence-dupnik-blames-az-political-culture-for-shooting-video/), and others, continued to lie, slander, and libel the tea party, Rush Limbaugh, Sarah Palin, Glenn Beck, and conservatives in general.

**Liberalism is at war with the American system. **

On New Year’s Even, liberal icon Frances [Fox-Piven called for a violent overthrow](https://www.newsrealblog.com/2011/01/05/marxist-frances-fox-piven-calls-for-a-violent-uprising-against-the-american-system/) of the American system.  Liberals attacked anyone who criticized Fox-Piven’s hatred.

On December 17, Missouri Democrat [Claire McCaskill called for violence](https://gatewaypundit.rightnetwork.com/2010/12/claire-mccaskill-promotes-violence-if-dems-dont-get-their-historic-tax-hikes-it-really-is-time-for-americans-to-take-up-pitchforks-video/) if Congress extended the Bush tax cuts.  Gabrielle Giffords, the target of Jared Loughner’s murderous rampage, [voted to extend those tax cuts](https://dailycaller.com/2010/12/17/house-roll-call-bill-to-extend-tax-cuts/).

There is no CNN special investigaing McCaskill’s hateful call for violence. Why not?

Why are liberals allowed to encourage murder while conservatives are vilified even for pointing out liberal hate? Where are the calls for McCaskill’s resignation?  As PO’ed Patriot points out, the [leftist media use tragedy as a weapon](https://www.poedpatriot.com/2011/01/tragic-arizona-shooting-used-as-weapon.html).

**It’s a shameful day in America. **
