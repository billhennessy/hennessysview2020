Let’s knock off the silly political correctness, here, and admit what’s going in Wisconsin. The teachers are trying collapse the system.

 

The National Education Association is a radical, political organization whose primary purpose is not education but control. Threatened with sensible legislation that protects the people of Wisconsin from unsustainable and unjustified retirement benefits, these teachers decided to shut down Wisconsin’s schools.

 

The solution is simple. Do what Reagan did to PATCO. Fire them. Fire them all and revoke their certifications.

 

[Wisconsin’s striking teachers](https://gatewaypundit.rightnetwork.com/2011/02/nine-violent-protesters-arrested-in-madison-wisconsin/) are not educators, they’re conquistadors. Fire them. Let them start over.
