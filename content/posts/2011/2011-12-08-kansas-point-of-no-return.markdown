Tuesday in Kansas, President Barack Obama revealed his contempt for liberty. He declared that human beings are incapable of running their own lives . . . but, somehow, other, superior human beings are capable of running their own and others’.

He said that free markets have always failed, everywhere . . . ignoring most of the last 240 years. 

He all but declared himself a Marxist. 

I am depressed that America let this dangerous man into our government. 

There are so many things to be done. So many. 

But our president hates this country. His speech on Tuesday was a point of no return for him and for us. We are the only people who can fix it.

Let’s clear our plates and our minds. We have 11 months until the most important presidential election of our lives.

Let’s not blow it.
