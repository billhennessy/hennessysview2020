I’m torn.

Yesterday, I took part in a [demonstration outside Senator Claire McCaskill’s](https://gatewaypundit.rightnetwork.com/2011/02/tea-party-soup-line-forms-at-mccaskills-st-louis-office/) St. Louis office on Delmar. The future of the republic is important. We are concerned that Senator McCaskill put her re-election before Missouri jobs by lobbying the DNC to hold its 2012 convention in Charlotte, NC, instead of St. Louis, MO. 

 

Down the road, a group of [Cardinals fans held a demonstration outside Busch Stadium](https://stlouis.cbslocal.com/2011/02/05/fans-gather-to-urge-pujols-signing/). The future of future Hall of Famer Albert Pujols is important, too. It appears the [Cardinals owners have little interest in resigning Albert](https://www.stltoday.com/sports/baseball/professional/article_e67d388c-7514-55d4-b468-8ad6ad8780be.html). 

 

Both events drew about 25 participants. 

 

If St. Louis is America’s baseball city, and the possible exodus of the greatest ballplayer of our generation draws equally with a tea party event, then is St. Louis also America’s tea party city?

 

Oh, and the torn part. The next general election is in November 2012. Pujols becomes a free agent, effectively, in nine days. Maybe I should I have been at the stadium yesterday, instead?
