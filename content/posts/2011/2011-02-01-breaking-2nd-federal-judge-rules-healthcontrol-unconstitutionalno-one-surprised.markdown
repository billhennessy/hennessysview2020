](https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/iStock_000007404184Small.jpg)U.S. District Judge Roger Vinson today ruled Obamacare directly violates the Constitution by mandating that citizens buy health insurance.

 

This ruling goes further than the [previous Virginia ruling.](https://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703727804576017672495623838.html) Judge Vinson declared the entire Obamacare bill unconstitutional because the individual mandate portion is not severable from the rest of the law.

 

Third, Judge Vinson granted the plaintiffs “declaratory relief,” the functional equivalent of an injunction, freeing them from the burden of compliance. From the [Wall Street Journal](https://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703439504576116361022463224.html?mod=WSJ_hp_LEFTTopStories):

The Department of Justice said it would appeal the ruling.

 

This is great news for everyone who believes in the rule of law. It also points out how critical it is that we regain control of the U.S. Senate before one of the Supreme Court’s conservatives leaves the bench. The 5-4 balance of power currently favors (slightly) the rule of law. Any vacancies will be filled by an Obama appointee who would effectively overturn the idea of limited government. 

 

For now, though, share this great news with friends: ObamaCare is unconstitutional. And a federal judge said so.
