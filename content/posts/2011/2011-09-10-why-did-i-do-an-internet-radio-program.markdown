A couple of years ago, I stopped doing internet radio. I had several reasons for my decisions, and I stuck to them.

When Mark Gillar of [Tea Party Power Hour](https://www.teapartypowerhour.com/index.html) asked me to come onto his show, [I broke my rule](https://www.blogtalkradio.com/markgillar/2011/09/10/outstand-tea-party-leaders). Here's why.

First, Mark Gillar's professionalism and sincerity are spectacular.  His show is his mission to advance liberty and good government.

Second, Tea Party Power Hour has h[osted some amazing guests](https://www.teapartypowerhour.com/pastguests.html)--folks I'm very honored and very humbled to follow.

Finally, though, I appeared on the Power Hour because I'm so proud of what you've done in the St. Louis area. I wanted to spread the word around the nation: St. Louis hearts pump the life blood of this movement.

Please take a little break this weekend and[ listen to the Tea Party Power Hour.](https://www.blogtalkradio.com/markgillar/2011/09/10/outstand-tea-party-leaders)  And tell the world you're listening on Facebook and Twitter.

Then, get the [Tea Party S.O.B. Brigade T-Shirts](https://stlouisteaparty.com/s-o-b-brigade-store/).
