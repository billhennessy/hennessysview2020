The first St. Louis Tea Partier was Michelle Moore. In the annals of the Tea Party movement, the first action was a conference call held February 20, 2009. The only St. Louisan known to be on that call was Michelle Moore.

 

Now, Michelle needs our help. Michelle needs a kidney. She details everything (in living color) on [her blog, A Traditional Life Lived](https://www.atraditionallifelived.com/2011/02/kideny-update-no-bikini-for-youand.html).

 

If you can help—if you can’t point a donor her way—please do. And if you can’t, prayers are always welcome.
