A lot.

Today, Congress gave failing states and cities [$26 billion in Chinese loans](https://www.politico.com/news/stories/0810/40842.html). More failed policies bolstered.

Today, the Federal Reserve Board [reversed its plan to pay down the debt](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-08-10/fed-to-reinvest-principal-on-mortgage-proceeds-into-long-term-treasuries.html) in order to put off economic downturn until after the election.

Today, the Fed announced that [our future is bleak](https://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0567152a-a49c-11df-8c9f-00144feabdc0.html).

Today, we learned that the government probably [overstated 2nd quarter economic growth](https://www.zerohedge.com/article/another-revision-q2-gdp-number-jpm-firm-now-estimates-real-economic-performance-was-13-24)—by almost double. (h/t [Ed Morrissey](https://hotair.com/archives/2010/08/10/productivity-wholesale-sales-fall-in-latest-reports/))

Today, we learned that [inventories increased because people and businesses](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2010/08/wholesale-sales-declined-in-june-inventories-rose/61229/) aren’t buying.

Today, we learned that [productivity fell last quarter](https://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704164904575421051109791586.html?mod=WSJ_hps_LEFTWhatsNews), meaning workers are on the job, but there’s less for them to do.

If that much can go that bad in just one day, imagine how much more damage will be done by November 2.

And then the Democrats have 60 days to exact revenge on voters for retiring them at the ballot box.
