Interesting. Mounting evidence suggests [the White House may have been complicit](If so, even Democrats in Congress would be forced to open impeachment investigations) in [SEIU’s terrorism](https://www.foundingbloggers.com/wordpress/2010/05/is-president-obama-breaking-the-law/) (as defined [by U.S. Patriot Act](https://biggovernment.com/amarcus/2010/05/21/npa-seiu-terrorizes-child-breaks-laws-what-did-president-obama-know-and-when-did-he-know-it/#IDComment76532125)) of a [banker’s teenage son](https://www.purplepeoplebeaters.com/?p=853).

Quit the SEIU. No decent person would belong to an organization that openly, and with the federal government’s approval, uses terrorism to get its way.

 

Quit the DC Metro Police Force. The President is using you to promote domestic terrorism. Fight him—the real enemy.

 

Finally, is there anything more hypocritical and disgusting than a healthcare worker who joins the SEIU? I suppose they use their thugs to drum up business. Sinful. 

 

Read a great book on criminal history of the SEIU and its leaders: [Devil at My Doorstep](https://cart.bookmasters.com/marktplc/cart.php?buy=9780984145706P&pub=51900).
