[The final poll before Tuesday’s special election](https://publicpolicypolling.blogspot.com/2010/05/burns-critz-close.html) to fill Jack [](https://publicpolicypolling.blogspot.com/2010/05/burns-critz-close.html)Murtha’s unexpired seat in the U.S. House shows that Republican Tim Burns is neck and neck with Democrat and [pork barrel specialist Mark Critz](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/blogs/beltway-confidential/earmark-lobbyists-contractors-put-their-money-on-dem-in-race-to-replace-murtha-92087929.html). (Yes, Critz’s campaign is funded by lobbyists and special interests.)

PPP has it 48 to 47 Burns. 

 

That means GOTV will determine the winner. 

 

If you want to make a difference, here’s the four step plan:

 

    * Got friends in PA12? Call them. Ask them if they intend to vote for Tim Burns on Tuesday*** Email friends who live anywhere in western PA, eastern Ohio, or West Virginia asking them to contact their PA12 friends** Use twitter, facebook, or any other social networking channels to spread the word** Join the nationwide [Virtual Phone Bank](https://stlouisteaparty.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b6334042e74991364820c98c6&id=f73447ba24&e=b1e997cfb9)** Pray. For the next two days, let's set aside One Minute of Prayer at 3:00 p.m. local time. I've added a One Minute of Prayer event to our [Conservative Calendar.](https://stlouisteaparty.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b6334042e74991364820c98c6&id=225b7622ac&e=b1e997cfb9)  (And on Wednesday, we’ll take a moment to thank God for the election, no matter the results. )  This is a great chance to make a difference and set the tone for 2010.  

* Just asking someone if they intend to vote [increases the chance that they will vote](https://influenceatwork.com/Media/RBC/E_Brand_principles.pdf) by 40 percent, according to researcher Dr. Robert Cialdini.
