For (at least) the past two nights, Glenn Beck’s program has been spell-bindingly depressing and eye-gougingly infuriating. He’s chronicled the Obama administration’s anti-Constitutional transfer of power and wealth from private Americans to other countries. He’s shown that the administration has no concern over the 2010 election because it has no intention of obeying the laws passed by Congress.

For example, the newly appointed [Consumer Protection Czar, a hard-line communist, Elizabeth Warren](https://biggovernment.com/tfitton/2010/09/21/constitutional-government-under-assault-with-new-consumer-czar/), is funded directly from the U.S. Treasury. In other words, there’s nothing Congress can do to curtail her powers. She is literally a dictator whom only Obama can manage.

 

But does Beck’s presentation help or hurt? 

 

Since most of us took Psych 101, the Fight or Flight response has been updated to [Fight, Flight, or Freeze](https://psy.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/45/5/448#R040200267) (sometimes “Fright”) response. The “Freeze” in humans occurs when people face a superior danger and have no information on how to respond. While this state is most obvious in infants and children who are ill-equipped to either fight or flee, adults will freeze in response to terror if they have no signals or reference. 

 

Beck offers no solutions. At least, he hasn’t in the past two days. Yes, he tells us to pray. But he’s unwittingly driving people toward catatonia. And he’s doing this to the very people we most need engaged right now. 

 

I love Glenn, but he needs to offer solutions. Bring on guests who give people a path to survival. Offer some hope that America will return to a Constitutional Republic sometime in our lifetimes. 

 

I don’t have Glenn’s audience, but I will offer this: get involved now. Sheer numbers of Americans demanding a return to a Constitutional Republic will eventually put the fear of God into the Obama regime.

 

The solution is to get involved in your local Tea Party or 9-12 Project. Get involved now. Be the resistance. Be the republic. 

 

In Missouri, you have only 14 days to register to vote in the most important election of our lives.
