Dana Loesch invited Dick Morris onto her radio show today. Dana expected to discuss START with Mr. Morris. But Dick has a mind of his own. 

 

Morris decided, about a minute and a half into a five-minute segment, that he wanted to talk about the 2012 US Senate race in Missouri instead. Specifically, he wanted spend the segment campaigning for Sarah Steelman for the the Republican nomination. 

 

Decide for yourself: here’s the [link to Dana’s show](https://www.971talk.com/dana/index.aspx).

 

I honestly don’t know much about Steelman. Frankly, I’m a little burned out on electoral politics after 2010. But I do know it’s rude to hijack a talk show to endorse a candidate in a primary two years away.

 

I also know that Dick Morris has a history of abusing his celebrity status to campaign for candidates outside of federal election laws. On September 12, Dick violated protocols by dragging Roy Blunt onto the stage of the “[Gateway to November](https://biggovernment.com/bhennessy/2010/08/26/gateway-to-november-tea-party-in-st-louis/)” Tea Party in St. Louis. Seems to be a pattern of abusing gracious hosts, don’t you think?

 

The question is, does Dick do it for money?
