You’ll be in Grove Park in Grafton, Illinois, for:

 

[ALTON IL. T.E.A PARTY FIRST ANNIVERSARY](https://stlouisteaparty.com/2010/07/17/alton-tea-party-july-24th/)

 

“1776 FREEDOM RALLY”

 

**Saturday, July 24th 4pm-7pm**

 

Think about it. You’ve Fast Eddie’s right there. You’ve got two of the most haunted towns in America with Grafton and Alton. Great history, including homes that were critical to the Underground Railroad.

 

[[Map of Grafton](https://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&q=main+street+grafton,+il&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Main+St,+Grafton,+Jersey,+Illinois+62037&gl=us&ei=AWZCTPSWCMP88AbA9OjPDw&ved=0CBMQ8gEwAA&ll=38.969286,-90.426965&spn=0.02052,0.038581&z=15&iwloc=A)]

 

In short, you get to help make history in a place where history was made. 

 

I am so honored to return to speak for the second year in a row. Even better, Dr. Gina Loudon, hostess of the hottest new show on radio, will be there, too. Not to mention the great people of the Alton Tea Party and 9-12 Project, Veteran Michelle Sharp, and more.

I have to tell you about the [Alton Tea Party](https://www.altonteaparty.com/) and 9-12 Project people. These are the gold standard of _get out the vote_ heroes. By turning on the afterburners, they made history in Madison County at the Illinois primary this year. How so?

 

Madison County is typically a 2:1 Democrat vote in primaries. Not this year. Because of the ridiculous efforts of those two groups, Madison votes 3:1 Republican. Not only that, their voters understood First Principles. The demonstrated that understanding by voting over 40 percent for Adam Andrzjewski, the solid conservative who earned Lech Walesa’s endorsement. That’s 40 percent out of field of 6 candidates. 

 

Their efforts will make a difference again in November. Why not make the short drive to Grafton for this event. Then we’ll all stop at Fast Eddie’s for a cold one. You might even want to book a room at Pere Marquette State Park or one of the awesome, old hotels in Grafton or Alton. 

 

Please plan to join us at Grove Park in Alton next Saturday, July 24, at 4:00 p.m. It’s been a long 17 months, I know. But we’ve slackened the pace lately. Now it’s time to gear up for Election Season. And there’s no better organizations in the country to kick off elections than the Alton Tea Party and 9-12 Project.
