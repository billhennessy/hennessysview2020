For the past seventeen months, [Alex Rife has covered the conservative movement](https://www.conservativetvonline.com/index.php) with the highest quality video available. His work even [got me on The Daily Show](https://stlouisteaparty.com/2009/10/28/the-daily-show-finally-airs-gina-loudon-buycott-feature/) with Jon Stewart.

For Alex to continue his video apostolate, he needs our help.

I just joined his network for $5 a month.  [I hope you will, too](https://www.conservativetvonline.com/Donation.htm).  Today.

Alex has invested thousands of dollars and thousands of hours of his time in our mission. He has travelled to Washington, DC, and to every corner of Missouri and Illinois to make sure we leave the world a detailed record of our amazing movement.

But I just learned that Alex relies on us, the people, to continue his operation.  That’s why I signed up for $5 a month as soon as I got home from the Prop C Lit Drop in South St. Louis today.

For just a [monthly donation of $1, $5, or $10](https://www.conservativetvonline.com/Donation.htm)—or a one-time donation—you can help Alex continue his noble work.

Please do it now. [Click this link](https://www.conservativetvonline.com/Donation.htm) to donate or subscribe. It will  take less than a minute to subscribe to ConservativeTVOnline.com.  You will feel better about yourself for having helped. Please do this right now, because if you don’t do it now, you never will.

Please comment below after you’ve joined. Let’s build some momentum for Alex and his family.

Thank you. I’ll leave you with Alex’s video from the 2nd Amendment in Washington earlier this year.
