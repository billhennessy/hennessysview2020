[Money Bomb for Tim Bur](https://www.timburnsforcongress.com/)ns ends at 11:00 p.m. Central tonight!

](https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/jtowntea1.jpg) If you want the satisfaction of replacing pork-barreler and Marine-basher, John Murtha, with [fiscal conservative Tim Burns](https://www.timburnsforcongress.com/index2.php), then contributing to the money bomb will help.

 

If you have friends or family in Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional district, you might want to give them a call this weekend and ask them if they plan to vote in Tuesday’s election. (People who are asked if they intend to vote are 40 percent more likely to vote than those who are not asked ([Cialdini](https://influenceatwork.com/Media/RBC/E_Brand_principles.pdf)).) Make sure they’ve looked at where [Tim Burns stands on the issues](https://www.timburnsforcongress.com/html/issues.html).

 

Remember, this important election to fill Murtha’s seat is Tuesday, May 18.
