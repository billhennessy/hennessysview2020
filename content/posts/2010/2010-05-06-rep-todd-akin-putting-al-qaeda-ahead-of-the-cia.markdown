](https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/27381.jpg) Hey, one of our favorite members of Congress, and a true gentleman, [Todd Akin (R-MO), has made the front page of BigGovernment.com](https://biggovernment.com/takin/2010/05/05/putting-al-qaeda-ahead-of-the-cia/).

 

The Obama Justice Department is quietly investigating the lawyers associated with the John Adams Project who may have violated a number of laws in place to protect our covert operatives and their families. But so far, with few exceptions, the media and their friends on Capitol Hill havenâ€™t found this case nearly as interesting as Valerie Plame. Could it have anything to do with the ideological bent of the perpetrators?

 

Great piece, Mr. Akin, and welcome to Big Government.
