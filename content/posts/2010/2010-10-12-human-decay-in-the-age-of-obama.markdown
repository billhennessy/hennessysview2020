In 47BC, Julius Caesar assumed dictatorial power in Rome. He instituted “reforms” that transformed the Republic into the Empire. In the process, he became a dictator. Rome’s decent into oblivion began. In 44BC, seeing the damage Caesar’s tyranny and reforms, three men removed Caesar from power by the method of the day.

 

History moves faster now than it did 2,000 years ago. A megalomaniacal leaders bent on fundamentally transforming a nation can do remarkable damage in the blink of an eye. It’s not just the economy and institutions that rot from Obama’s sort of transformation, but the people themselves. Their souls erode, leaving hollow, bitter creatures that scratch at each others eyes. 

 

Peggy Noonan wrote about [the effects of Obama’s dreams](https://online.wsj.com/article/declarations.html) on the small country of Greece. She included this long quote from Michael Lewis from his [article in Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/business/features/2010/10/greeks-bearing-bonds-201010):

Once you saw how it worked you could understand a phenomenon which otherwise made no sense at all: the difficulty Greek people have saying a kind word about one another. . . . Everyone is pretty sure everyone is cheating on his taxes, or bribing politicians, or taking bribes, or lying about the value of his real estate. And this total absence of faith in one another is self-reinforcing. The epidemic of lying and cheating and stealing makes any sort of civic life impossible.

Wretched.

 

Yet it’s where America and Americans now aim: the shoals of soulless dissipation, turned by government handouts (stolen from us first) into angry, cynical vipers. Free isn’t free when it costs you your humanity.

 

November 2 is your chance to stop the erosion. We’re at 4512 Hampton Ave. in St. Louis Hills through the election. We’re there to stop Greece from happening in America. We offer no guarantees except your rightful place in history.
