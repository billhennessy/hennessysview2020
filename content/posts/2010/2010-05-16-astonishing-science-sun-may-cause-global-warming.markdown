Unbelievable! Scientists have discovered that the huge, glowing fireball in the sky may affect Earth’s temperature. 

 

The latest evidence comes from . . . the Moon. 

 

Back when we used to send astronauts to the Moon, we placed some temperature sensors on the Moon’s surface. We still monitor those sensors.

 

Guess what they show. Yep, you’re right! As temperatures rose on Earth, temperatures rose on the Moon.

[Watts Up With That has all the details](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2010/05/16/extraterrestrial-global-warming/#more-19550). 

 

Meanwhile, [Gateway Pundit](https://gatewaypundit.firstthings.com/) found scientists who issued a crop warning because of an anticipated [plunge in Earth’s temp](https://gatewaypundit.firstthings.com/2010/05/brrrr-scientists-issue-new-warning-of-imminent-food-ethanol-shortages-due-to-global-cooling/), at least in North America.
