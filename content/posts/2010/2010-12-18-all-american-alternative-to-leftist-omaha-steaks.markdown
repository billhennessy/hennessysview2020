Jim Hoft of [Gateway Pundit exposed Omaha Steak’s leftism](https://gatewaypundit.rightnetwork.com/2010/12/after-yesterdays-nasty-note-omaha-steaks-now-say-they-didnt-drop-glenn-beck-ads/#comments) yesterday. Omaha pulled its ads from Glenn Beck for ideological reasons.

> We took your comments regarding the Glenn Beck Program to heart. **After further review and careful consideration, we have decided to pull all advertising from Glenn Beck programming effective December 20th**, 2010.

Then the president of the company, Bruce Simon, [tried to deny his political motives](https://steakbytes.com/2010/12/omaha-steaks-television-advertising-policy/comment-page-1/#comment-2229).

 

If you want to order top quality meats at great prices, you don’t have to put money in a lefty’s pocket. Instead, order from [Pat Boone’s AllAmerican Meat company](https://www.patboonemeats.com/).

Pat Boone isn’t just a 50s singing star and father of Debbie Boone. He’s also [a Tea Partier](https://www.delish.com/food/recalls-reviews/pat-boones-beef) and pro-military American.

 

His company donates 5 percent to alleviate world hunger. So Pat’s not just all-American, pro-Tea Party, and pro-troops, he’s a humanitarian!

 

Support America. Support humanity. Hit a liberal in the pocketbook. Buy All-American Meats.
