Between a touch of the flu and the flurry of activity over this very issue, I missed the best, most direct breakdown of Ben Jealous's misguided and hypocritical attack on the Tea Party.  Read this [column by Michael Graham](https://news.bostonherald.com/news/opinion/op_ed/view.bg?articleid=1267998) on BostonHerald.com dated Thursday, July 15.

Money quote:


> When you’re looking for bigots at a Tea Party rally, they’re on the fringe. When you’re looking for them at the NAACP, they’re on stage.


Ouch.

When we find bigots, even on the fringe, at a St. Louis event, we drive them out. And we don't hide the fact that they were there.

At the April 15 Tea Party in Clayton, MO, [Adam Sharp](https://sharpelbowsstl.blogspot.com/) and several others drove from the park a guy wearing Nazi crap. They did it by standing next to him with a sign that read "Fake Tea Partier" while Sharp verbally challenged him.  Lee Fang, a "researcher" with American Progress with[ a history of shredding the truth](https://www.verumserum.com/?p=7649), has doctored Sharp's great video (without legal permission). Here's what actually happened.

Perhaps if the NAACP treated the racists and anti-Semites in their midst the way the Tea Party does, Mr. Jealous wouldn't be so busy [back-peddling from his hypocritical lies](https://gatewaypundit.firstthings.com/2010/07/breaking-naacp-prez-tries-to-weasel-his-way-out-of-controversial-attack-on-tea-party-patriots/) today.

By "racists" and "anti-Semites," I mean Louis Farrakhan, [Rev. Jeremiah Wright](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axu1i_DS6jo&feature=related), [Jesse Jackson](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/frenzy/jackson.htm), and Al Sharpton, to name only a few.  As Mr. Graham pointed out, "This is the leadership of the NAACP, not some lone kook in a vast crowd."

Now that the President and [Joe Biden have admitted that the Tea Party is not a racist movement](https://poedpatriot.blogspot.com/2010/07/biden-tea-parties-not-racist.html), it seems Mr. Jealous and the NAACP are all alone, twisting in the wind.

Mr. Jealous seemed to want us to admit we're intolerant?  We are.  We don't tolerate racism. Period.
