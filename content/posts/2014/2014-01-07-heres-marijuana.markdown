Last week's Weednesday Post generated several comments that took my side but the facts wrong. Specifically, a couple of commenters claimed "marijuana is harmless." That's not true.

While cannabis may be have fewer harmful effects than alcohol and tobacco, someone who abstains from all three will be healthier mentally and physically than the same person smoking pot.

On the other hand, a lot proponents of prohibition throw around bad science, too. The prohibition lobby has generated tons of false "facts" to manipulate the debate.

Luckily,[ Business Insider cataloged what we know about cannabis--good and bad](https://www.businessinsider.com/health-effects-of-marijuana-2014-1?op=1).  Take a look at this slide show. Here are the top positives and negatives of smoking weed.

Finally, decriminalized or not, cannabis is illegal in Missouri. I think that's a really bad law, but it is the law. In fact, [Missouri has the most draconian pot laws in the country](https://www.mpp.org/states/missouri/). Growing, possessing, buying, selling, and smoking are all crimes. And [suspicious activity--like an indoor garden--subject you and your family to SWAT raids and searches](https://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/03/29/ex-cia-employees-who-garden-indoors-claim-their-kansas-home-was-illegally/), even if you've never seen a pot plant.
