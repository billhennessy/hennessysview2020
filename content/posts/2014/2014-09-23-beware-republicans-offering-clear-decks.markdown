> Why did the chicken cross the road?

To get to the lame duck.



You can't trust the GOP establishment.

In case you missed it, the House GOP leadership pushed a Continuing Resolution to fund government through December. Now, these same GOP leaders will tell you they expect Republicans to take over the Senate in January. So why would they give Harry Reid a chance to use the lame duck Congress in December to pass an Obama-friendly long term CR?

**"To clear the decks,"** is the talking point the establishment will use.

In short, the House GOP and their corporate masters want to lock in special favors before a more conservative Congress takes over in 2015. As Obama told Medvedev about nuclear negotiations, the House GOP will have more flexibility on corporate welfare after the election.

If it walks like a lame duck and squawks like a lame duck, it probably wants to the clear the decks of free market thinking. Which is why [I'm voting against Ann Wagner, and you should, too](https://hennessysview.com/2014/09/21/will-not-vote-for-wagner/).
