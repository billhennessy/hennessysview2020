Hi. Bill Hennessy here. If you can, please stop by 111 Clarkson Executive Park, Ellisville, MO 63011 on Tuesday, September 2 at 7 p.m. ([RSVP Here](https://www.facebook.com/events/633186240135605/?context=create&source=49) if you'd like.)





I have something I'd like to talk to you about. It's about the tea party movement. But it's really about understanding two very important concepts:






*1. Living to our purpose.
*2. Doing what's important.




This is not a training session. It's not an After Party. It's not a rally. It's an honest conversation with a call to action.





It's about the things that made St. Louis Tea Party the most effective and most talked about tea party in the country in 2009 and 2010, where and why we strayed from our original purpose, and what I am going to do to get back to that original purpose.





I don't know if this new mission will be an official St. Louis Tea Party Coalition project or not. That's one of the reasons for this conversation.





I want you, the people who've stood with me through all my many failings, to hear the mission I'm going on. I hope you'll join me, but I understand if you do not.
