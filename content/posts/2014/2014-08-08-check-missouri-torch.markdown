Duane Lester has built a fantastic blog. [The Missouri Torch](https://themissouritorch.com/) captures the most important Missouri political news every day and sends you a convenient link list.

Plus, Duane's original pieces are crisp, smart, witty, and dead on. And, like Rush Limbaugh, Duane is almost always right 99.872% of the time. Plus, the site design is elegantly miminalist, easy to navigate, and easy on the eye.

Good work, Mr. Lester.

P.S. I am not a paid sponsor and no one asked me to write this.
