[Eurozone's economy is basically in recession](https://www.businessinsider.com/euro-zone-gdp-2014-8).

[Walmart lowered expectations](https://www.businessinsider.com/wal-mart-q2-earnings-2014-8). Again.

[The world is teetering on the edge of World War](https://www.businessinsider.com/russias-aid-convoy-has-gone-rogue-and-is-headed-to-rebel-held-ukraine-2014-8).

[The US is launching Iraq War 3.0](https://www.businessinsider.com/obama-struggles-with-being-pulled-back-into-iraq-amid-isis-rampage-2014-8): Mission Accomplished Accomplished.

[Germany's economy is flat,](https://www.businessinsider.com/germany-10-year-yield-below-1-2014-8) and Italy and [France are getting worse](https://www.businessinsider.com/r-german-slump-stagnant-france-paint-dismal-eurozone-picture-2014-14).

[Risk is high](https://www.businessinsider.com/root-of-abrupt-market-losses-2014-8).

[Corporate debt is staggering.](https://www.businessinsider.com/root-of-abrupt-market-losses-2014-8)

[The Fed's balance sheet ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-11/fed-prepares-to-keep-super-sized-balance-sheet-for-years-to-come.html)is a sea of monetized debt.

[The central banks have nothing left to fix another crash](https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-08-08/are-central-banks-out-options).

And the [stock markets are rocketing to record highs](https://www.businessinsider.com/market-jump-august-14-2014-8) because of all this news.

What the hell is wrong with people?

_UPDATE_

More good news for stocks and bad news for the rest of us since I printed this at 6:30 a.m.:

[Jobless claims jumped by 21,000](https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-08-14/initial-jobless-claims-jump-21000-biggest-miss-3-months)—the most in 3 months.

[Import prices dropped 0.2 percent](https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-08-14/import-prices-have-first-drop-april-price-imported-cars-plunges-most-1992) as European deflation comes to America.

And [Putin calls for end of US Dollar as world's reserve currency](https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-08-14/putin-says-petrodollar-must-die-dollar-monopoly-energy-trade-damaging-russias-econom).

Perhaps the stock traders are sobering up, though, as US futures have gone from skyrocketing to flat.
