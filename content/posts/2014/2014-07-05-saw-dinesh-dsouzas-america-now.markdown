What if America didn't exist?

That's the premise of [Dinesh D'Souza's new movie ](https://www.americathemovie.com/)_[America: Imagine the world without her](https://www.americathemovie.com/)._ ([Find a theatre near you](https://www.fandango.com/america_174736/movietimes?location=63011).)

Last Wednesday, my wife took Samantha, Jordan, and me to see the movie to kick off Independence Day weekend. Even without the movie, this July 4th was special for me. My son, [Jack, re-enlisted in the US Navy on board the USS Missouri in Pearl Harbor](https://hennessysview.com/2014/07/05/awesome-video-us-army-sergeant-tells-iraqi-police-way/).

Plus, the holiday gives me a welcomed break from a hectic month at work. And there's parties to go to and the finest 4th of July weather St. Louis has had in a long time--since 1997, if memory serves.

But I'm going to ask you to take someone to see America: Imagine the world without her. You'll probably learn something new and important no matter how much you read.

For example, does the name Madame C. J. Walker mean anything to you? It should. If not, D'Souza will fill you in by answering the question, "Why don't we ever hear about America's first self-made millionairess?" The answer will surprise you.

Something else I learned—well, confirmed: Hillary Clinton is ideologically closer to Barack Obama than she is to her husband Bill.

I know Dinesh D'Souza's had some issues with hubris of late, but that's all the more reason to see America. He confronts his problems and points out how the Obama administration uses its power to reward friends and crush enemies.

In the end, America is about the real battle for liberty. America is liberty's last and greatest hope. If liberty dies here, there's no place else to run to.

The more people see America by D'Souza, the better the odds that liberty will prevail.
