I am scaling back my blogging.

I spend about 1-2 hours on most posts. That's writing, researching, photo editing, etc. It's time consuming. It's also worth the effort.

Blogging is an opportunity cost, too. Every hour I spend blogging is an hour I'm not doing anything else. The things I'm not doing include:




** admiring my wife
** talking to my kids
** catching up with friends
** advancing my career
** cleaning up my office
** changing my underwear
** cheering on the Blues (or Cardinals or Rams)
** working out
** washing my car
** fixing that door that doesn't open right
** training my dogs to make a proper CC and club soda
** paying bills
** answering emails
** blowing the leaves out of the garage
** hunting copperheads and rattlesnakes (we have both out here)
** visiting my parents


At the same time, I'm scaling back some other political activity to focus on two important issues:


** Municipal courts
** Grassroots strategy


I'll still post blogs. Maybe more than I have been. But the posts will be short, personal, and even more opinionated than they have been.

I'm sure I'll return to the long form blog in future. After 5 years of this activism, though, I need to bother some other people in my life.

In the meantime, keep the faith. Own your own life. And work for your interests, not your positions.
