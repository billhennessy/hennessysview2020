The weird thing is: isn't that Sharp Elbows questioning the Chief? When did he become a detective in Michigan?

The chief pleaded _nolo contendere_ to identity theft charges. He presented himself as a tea party leader signing up for embarrassing, sexual email lists. From [the La Crosse Tea Party](https://www.lacrosseteaparty.com/2014/06/campbell-police-chief-confesses-harassing-tea-party/):



> A shocking update to the Town of Campbell Situation this week. Detective Spencer from Monroe County Sheriff’s department called and said that Campbell Police Chief Tim Kelemen confessed to harassment/internet stalking/identity theft regarding my complaint filed to La Crosse P.D. in January when someone signed me up for 15 or so internet accounts ranging from a gay profile on Match.com to Healthcare.com.



The La Crosse city council will meet next week to decide whether to terminate the chief.
