I know from my hit map that I have several regular readers in Israel.  I have written a fair amount on my view of the current, and I continue to pray for Israel’s victory.

On a personal note, though, I must share with you the words of Our Lady, Mother of Israel’s savior and of mine, when, in her Canticle to her kinswoman, Elizabeth, she said:



> He has come to the aid of his servant Israel
for he has remembered his promise of mercy,
the promise he made to our fathers,
to Abraham and his children for ever.



In the Catholic church, we find few words of greater comfort.  Nor do we find many prayers as forthright as Mary’s praise earlier in the Canticle:



> the Almighty has done great things for me,
and holy is his Name.



May the words of Our Lady bring you comfort and remind you, too, that the Lord made a promise to Abraham, and the Lord always keeps his promise.  May you, too, find fulfillment of that promise in life, death, and resurrection of his Son.

Dominus vobiscum and shalom.
