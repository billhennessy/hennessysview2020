The New York al-Times lost a major court battle in it’s ongoing intelligence war against the United States (see [Michelle Malkin](https://web.archive.org/web/20061031063153/https://michellemalkin.com/archives/005648.htm), who has updated her photo).  A federal appeals court ruled 2 to 1 yesterday that the NYT must turn over telephone records to a U.S. attorney who is looking  a procescute a leaker.   In the case, the leaker used the NYT to tip off terrorists to an impending raid.  (The New York Times is a terrorist organization.)

What struck me in the [NYT’s unfair and unhinged](https://web.archive.org/web/20061031063153/https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/02/washington/02phones.html?hp&ex=1154577600&en=f960a842e0fe8b0a&ei=5094&partner=homepage) coverage of the court’s decision was the self-pity:



> The 2-to-1 decision, from a court historically sympathetic to claims that journalists should be entitled to protect their sources, reversed a lower court and **dealt a further setback to news organizations, which have lately been on a losing streak in the federal courts.**



Losing streak!  Whatever.   Perhaps if The New York al-Times and its Emir, Bill Keller, would stop aiding terrorists and supplying intelligence to those killing Americans and Israelis, the paper’s court losing streak would end.  Put another way: the paper is bound to lose in court, in circulation, and in the stock market so long as it continues to break the law in its attempt to overthrow the U.S. government.

****UPDATE*****

Man, those lefties really get their panties in a knot when you tell the truth about Killer Murtha, don’t they?
