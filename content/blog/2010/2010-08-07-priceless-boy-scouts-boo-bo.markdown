I guess this is the Boy Scout Jamboree. It’s too wonderful to research. 

 

On the big screen, we see The One, The Despot, Barack “Ass Kicker” Obama.

 

In the foreground, we see and hear Boy Scouts booing and mocking and jeering.

Part of me wishes the Boy Scouts were more respectful of the President of the United States, no matter who occupies that office. But another part of me believes that Obama is such a disgraceful, un-American anomaly that to disrespect him is to honor the United States. 

 

What do you think?
