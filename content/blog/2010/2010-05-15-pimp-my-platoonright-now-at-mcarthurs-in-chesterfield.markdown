Come to McArthur’s in Chesterfield Sat. May 15,2010. Starting at 7:00 A.M. to say hi to Dr. Randy Tobler from 97.1 Talk radio and make a donation for Dave’s son Moose and his Marine comrades in Afghanistan.

 

Bring a care package for the troops

 

I heard this morning that Moose was recently injured?
