A truer leader never walked this land

In human relations, there is a fixed ratio between leaders and those they lead.

 

The people trust leaders as much as the leader trusts the people.

 

In my lifetime, no leader ever trusted me as much as Ronald Reagan.

 

And I have trusted no leader as much as I trusted him.

 

And we never even met.
