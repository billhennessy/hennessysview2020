Democrats are planning to punish the American people with draconian, destructive legislation during the [lame duck session following November’s election, according the Wall Street Journal](https://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704293604575343262629361470.html?mod=WSJ_Opinion_LEADTop).

Retiring or defeated members of Congress would then be able to vote for sweeping legislation without any fear of voter retaliation.

Cowardly bastards.

He told Mr. Press "we're still trying to maneuver" a way to pass some parts of the bill before the next Congress is sworn in.

In other words, these slimy frauds will retaliate against the people of this country by shoving more corruption down our throats. 

 

If this doesn’t inspire every American to politically kick the teeth down the throat of the Democratic Party, nothing will. Let’s defeat the s.o.b.s so completely they couldn’t get elected dog-catcher in a town their family owns.

Let’s begin with an enormous turnout on August 3 to send a clear message about ObmaCare by voting [Yes on Proposition C](https://www.mohealthfreedom.org/). 

 

From Labor Day to Election Day, let’s flood Missouri and Southern Illinois with the largest grassroots campaign for patriotic candidates in American history. While we don’t have funding from billionaires to hire college kids, we have thousands of dedicated American patriots who will tirelessly.

 

Put in for vacation November 1, 2, and 3. Your country will need you to get out the vote the first and second. And you’ll need to sit back and smile on November 3. 

 

Fight, fight, fight, fight like your children’s lives depend on it. 

 

They’ve strangled Pursuit of Happiness.

 

They’ve targeted Liberty. 

 

Can Life be far behind?
