Someday I’ll write more – much more – on this. But it’s important to remember what’s at stake in America, in the world, this election: beauty.

 

Totalitarian regimes despise beauty. They bury it in palaces where the rulers roam, their cancerous eyes raking over someone’s masterpiece the way raw sewage pollutes a clear stream after a pipe’s failure. 

 

Regimes, in their attempts to hoard beauty, bury it. 

 

In free America (remember it?) high art never made it big because such beauty surrounded everything. Little country churches with their Godly whiteness graced the eye, their choirs the ear, with a love no painting or opera could equal. 

 

But the regime wants beauty controlled, corralled, and collected in government warehouses to be doled out—distributed—like . . . like money. 

 

If freedom dies, beauty hibernates.

 

Let freedom ring; let God’s light fill the earth.

 

Vote November 2. Vote for yourself. Vote for the people. Vote against the regime.
