](https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/obamasnob1.gif) An arrogant and distracted Barack Obama appeared at a press conference for the G20 Summit today. His purpose: to insult, threaten, and cajole the American people from an international stage.

People should learn that lesson about me because next year when I start presenting some very difficult choices to the country, I hope some of these folks who are hollering about deficits and debt step-up because I'm calling their bluff. We'll see how much of that, how much of the political arguments that they're making right now are real and how much of it was just politics.

This childish behavior reminds me of a very young manager who is unfamiliar with the subtleties of working through others. We all know the jokes about Second Lieutenants and Ensigns whose troops despise them. Unfit managers become tyrants, stealing the credit, passing the blame, and publicly humiliating instead of leading.

 

I have worked for such cretins. They always fail, though they often last longer than expected. Many people will put up with a tyrant a long time before someone stands up. 

 

Standing up is what the tea party movement has been doing since Feburary 27, 2009. We’re the American people the president threatened today from Toronto.

 

Remarkably, Obama is threatening to use the trillions of debts he generated to punish Americans. He spoke in dictatorial terms, like Chavez or Mussolini, warning his countrymen to fear his wrath.

 

For those who believe Obama has no ill-will for the USA, [let this be your wake-up call](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2010/06/27/obama_calling_bluff_of_those_complaining_about_debt_he_created.html).

 

Getting back to the implied antecedent in “I said I was going to do it.” The “it” is clearly taking on massive government debt. In November, his party could lose control of Congress. So his strategy is clearly to induce economic collapse in 2011, blame it on the “bourgeoisie” Republicans, and hope the American people will give Obama even more dictatorial power in 2012.

 

That’s the game, kids. Do you want a dictator?
