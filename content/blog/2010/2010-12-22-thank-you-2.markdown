[Hennessy’s View](https://hennessysview.com/) is now 255 on Wikio’s Political Blog rankings. I know that’s nothing compared to [Gateway Pundit](https://gatewaypundit.rightnetwork.com/). After 10 years of blogging, though, it’s nice to crack some list somewhere.

 

If you’d like to see me move higher on this list, please use the social buttons below.

 

Also, please tell me why you read Hennessy’s View in the comments. 

 

Thanks, again, for a great Christmas present.
