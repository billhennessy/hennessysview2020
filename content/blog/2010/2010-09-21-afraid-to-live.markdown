Leftist philosophies lead to despotism. Despotism appeals to some people because:

 

1. They don’t have to think.

 

2. They won’t face consequences.

 

Problems arise when the people who _thought_ they didn’t want to think decide to think for themselves. Traditionally, the despots either kill or incarcerate the thinkers.

 

Eventually, too many people think, the prisons overflow, and the people kill or incarcerate the despot.

 

Instead of living through this cycle of violence again, why don’t we stop the despot now?

 

Vote November 2. Vote for a candidate who believes in people, not government.
