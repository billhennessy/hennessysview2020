Here’s a passage from a fine _[roman a clef](https://www.amazon.com/Ravelstein-Penguin-Great-Books-Century/dp/0141001763):_

> [I]f the worst were to happen and a local armed militia were to descend on me and drive me out as a Jewish alien, their offense mainly would be against the Jew, not against the landowner. And in such a case my concern would be for the U.S. Constitution, not for my investment. The rooms, the rocks, the vegetation had no hold on my vital organs. If I were to lose it, I’d live elsewhere. But if the Constitution, the legal foundation of it all, were to be destroyed, we would return to the primal chaos

[Saul Bellow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Bellow) and the subject of that wonderful novel, [Allen Bloom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Bloom), are gone. They these days coming, it seems. Allen Bloom’s 1987 masterpiece, _[The Closing of the American Mind](https://www.amazon.com/Closing-American-Mind-Allan-Bloom/dp/0671657151),_ warned the world of the dangers posed by the modern American university. 

 

But did we listen?

 

In tribute Bellow, a great American writer, and Bloom, a great American philosopher, let’s begin the hard work of turning back our descent into “primal chaos.”
