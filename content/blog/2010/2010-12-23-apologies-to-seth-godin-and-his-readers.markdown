I tried to manually trackback to [Seth Godin’s post](https://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/12/three-ways-tv-changed-everything-and-whats-next.html) on TV [from this post](https://hennessysview.com/2010/12/23/not-so-fast-seth/).

 

Between WordPress’s false negatives on reporting success of links, my laptop’s touchy touchpad, and Typepad’s weird trackback URL system, I managed to:

 

a. Link once to the wrong blog post

 

b. Link twice to the right blog post

 

I pride myself on being respectful of blogging etiquette. I hate trackback spam. I hate it even more when I’m the one creating it.

 

I am sorry to Seth and his readers.
