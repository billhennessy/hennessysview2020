Each day, more economists jump onto the [Double-Dip bandwagon](https://blogs.wsj.com/marketbeat/2010/08/23/yes-folks-hindenburg-omen-tripped-again/). Signs abound that the natural economic recovery that would normally follow a deep recession won’t happen. Instead, the economy is now saddled with so much debt, so many regulations, and such onerous new taxes that the Obama Administration tells us to be happy with 9.5 percent unemployment.

Barack Obama is an economic disaster of the first order.

 

So why all the pessimism?

 

Well, every week it seems we’re hit with wave after wave of bad news. At the same time, Biden and Obama tour the country telling the unemployed they never had it so good. Here’s today’s top stories on [Drudge](https://www.drudgereport.com):

Here’s a link to one of the stories—on CNBC—that says we have left recession and entered . . . [economic DEPRESSION](https://www.cnbc.com/id/38831550).

 

And that brings us to this week’s triple-play of disastrous economic news.

 

First, [existing home sales fell by 27 percent in July](https://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703447004575449352676306326.html?mod=WSJ_hps_LEFTWhatsNews) to the lowest levels in 15 years. At the same time, inventories climbed and interest rates fell. That means [prices will have drop dramatically](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/Home-Sales-Plunge-Prices-to-zacks-1841380794.html;_ylt=Ag_Tp0lP4hjUXuP9FRqbzi67YWsA;_ylu=X3oDMTFhdTMxcTE2BHBvcwM0BHNlYwNzcGVjaWFsRmVhdHVyZXMEc2xrA2hvbWVzYWxlc3BsdQ--?x=0) before the housing market can recover.

 

Second, [durable goods orders](https://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703632304575451094199930012.html?mod=WSJ_hps_LEFTWhatsNews), excluding transportation, fell by 3.8 percent in July. Economists and analysts expected a 12 percent rise. That means businesses have abandoned hope of recovery.

 

Third, [existing home sales plummeted 12 percent](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/July-new-home-sales-fall-to-apf-3029003398.html?x=0&sec=topStories&pos=main&asset=&ccode=) in July to the lowest level on record.

 

Why can’t the economy find solid footing? Because America can no longer afford the government in Washington. With [government workers earning twice as much as people who actually produce value](https://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/income/2010-08-10-1Afedpay10_ST_N.htm) in the economy, wage earners can afford only two things: subsistence and taxes. Truly, the government has erected a multitude of New Offices and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people and eat out their substance.

 

Either we cut the cost of government or die. That’s a stark choice. But it’s the one we’ve been given.
