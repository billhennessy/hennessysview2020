[Dana Loesch](https://biggovernment.com/dloesch/2010/05/27/is-huffpo-threatening-political-pressure-in-gladney-case-on-behalf-of-seiu/) and [24th State](https://www.24thstate.com/2010/05/seiu-pays-media-matters-50000-in-wake-of-gladney-incident.html) have revealed the ring of corruption that extends from St. Louis bloggers and local St. Louis leftist rag, through SEIU, to Media Matters and Huffington Post.

 

An additional crook in this den of thieves is [Democrat Senator Bob Casey](https://casey.senate.gov/contact/) of Pennsylvania. Casey has introduced yet another bailout package. This time, the bailout is intended to repay corrupt unions like SEIU and AFL-CIO for bankrupting their members’ retirements by bribing the media and politicians.

### **What You Can Do**

 

    1. Call any SEIU member you know and ask them to quit the corrupt union that beats innocent people for political gain.*2. Melt Senator Bob Casey’s phone lines and flood his in box (Address and phones below).*3. Ensure Democrat Bob Casey is a member of the minority following November 2010 elections.*4. Redistribute, [embed the Prezi above](https://prezi.com/z6yl013mcadi/) everywhere you can.   

This is corruption compounded by physical, criminal assault and [political intimidation](https://biggovernment.com/amarcus/2010/05/28/dc-bank-protest-showdown-in-america-motives-3-and-4/). And Bob Casey want _you_ to fund it at gun point.
