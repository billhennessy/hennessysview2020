[Barney Frank Comes Home to the Facts](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2010/08/21/barney_frank_comes_home_to_the_facts_106844.html).

Remarkable.  Is this is a true change in heart, a real wising-up, of one of Congress's biggest Fannie and Freddie supporters?  Or is Barney Frank playing some angle here.

Let's hope it's the former.  The best thing for America would be an awakening among big government Democrats. Imagine if Frank became a deficit hawk and a Tenther!.
