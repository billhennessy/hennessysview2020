This is my opinion, and it’s not all about politics. Nor are they necessarily in any particular order. Save for one. (You’ll see.)

 

    * [Nancy Pelosi](https://www.cnsnews.com/node/55971), [Phil Hare](https://biggovernment.com/publius/2010/04/01/rep-phil-hare-d-il-i-dont-worry-about-the-constitution/), and other Democrats admit their contempt for the US Constitution.** Barack Obama continues [bowing](https://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2009/04/obama_bows_down_to_saudi_king.html) to tin-horn dictators . . . who really are his superiors.** Rep. Russ [Carnahan funnels millions of tax dollars](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=13&ved=0CCsQFjACOAo&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgatewaypundit.rightnetwork.com%2F2010%2F10%2Fthats-weird-state-run-media-reports-on-carnahan-wind-farm-scandal%2F&ei=pLwSTfyxAoXGlQfCxvH6Cw&usg=AFQjCNGqHk_kEl6bWinUxSTFv6rjDZ8M1g&sig2=OGLfK5UEIUZF1jZDypt1Uw) to his family business.** The business world discovers “[gamification](https://blogs.hbr.org/haque/2010/12/unlocking_the_mayor_badge_of_m.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+harvardbusiness+(HBR.org)),” an idea that will turn marketing upside in 2011.** Europe suffers [third consecutive frigid winter](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-12-20/heathrow-europe-travelers-face-third-day-of-disruption-on-snow-forecast.html).** [Republicans gain 63 House seats](https://www.newsmax.com/InsideCover/Republicans-gain-twoseats-Democraticconcessions/2010/11/24/id/378051) to take it back after only two terms in the minority.** [Republicans gain six seats in the US Senate](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=6&ved=0CEIQFjAF&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbsnews.com%2Fstories%2F2010%2F11%2F02%2Fpolitics%2Fmain7016426.shtml&ei=Yb8STdn4FsP6lweo-_yXDA&usg=AFQjCNF_d16ETy-8mpFr4SyWbKUFDPBURQ&sig2=LXKJe5nmnJdX9pRopsG63w), placing that body within easy striking distance for 2012.** Barack [Obama’s popularity hovers at 40 percent](https://www.lifenews.com/2010/12/13/nat-6923/), the traditional “point of no return.”** [Wikileaks embarrasses the White House](https://biggovernment.com/tag/wikileaks/) and endangers intelligence operatives’ lives. But Obama only reacts because of the embarrassment.** [The Tea Party becomes a long-term movement](https://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2036683_2037118_2037102,00.html) that continues to disrupt and surprise.   

That’s the top ten list. But the top story is not here.

 

**The top story of 2010: Republicans **[**gain more than 600 state legislature seats**](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/11/03/republicans-make-historic-gains-state-legislatures-pick-hundreds-seats/)**. **

 

Why is that important? Because those new legislatures give the GOP a conservative bench to dominate national and state policy for generations.
