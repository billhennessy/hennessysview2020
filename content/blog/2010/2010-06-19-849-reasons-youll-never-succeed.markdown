Major General Stephen Layfield, the reviewing officer at the Navy’s June 11 Boot Camp Graduation, introduced my son, AT Jack Hennessy, and 848 of Jack’s fellow sailors to America's enemies. He mocked at our enemies’ plots to destroy America, pointing out that before him stood “eight hundred and forty-nine reasons why you’ll never succeed.”

 

The crowd of about 4,000 roared. The sailors, in ranks, could not even clap. But I’m sure they smiled. 

 

Graduations are held in a huge field house at Great Lakes because of the unpredictable weather. My son, Patrick, and I sat in the in balcony of the auditorium. Below us was a sea of white Navy jumpers and a fine example of America’s future.

My son is now a full-fledged sailor. He’s in Pensacola for Aviation Technician Class A School. From there, he’ll come home on leave before continuing with Class C School, then onto an air squadron. 

 

Our enemies have 849 new reasons to hide in caves. And I have one more reason to be annoyingly proud of my son Jack.

Thanks to everyone who’s written and called to found out Jack’s doing. He appreciates your thoughts and prayers.
