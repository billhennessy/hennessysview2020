If you’ve never heard of [The Discussion Club](https://www.discussionclub.org/index.html), listen up. 

 

Since 1955, The Discussion Club has brought to St. Louis the heavyweights of the time.

 

    * Milton Friedman** Dr. Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn** Henry Regner** M. Stanton Evans** Dr. George C. Roche** Dr. Friedrich A. Von Haye (are you freakin’ kidding me?)** Dr. Russell Kirk (the father of American conservatism)** Arthur Laffer  And that’s just the 70s and 80s. The [list of past speakers](https://www.discussionclub.org/pastspeakers8.htm) reads like the history of National Review.  

On January 13, 2011, I have the distinct and rather frightening opportunity to follow this remarkable list of speakers.

 

If [you’d like to attend](https://www.discussionclub.org/howtoattend8.htm) (and I’d like you to), just call **314-416-7722 no later than January 11th. **(But do it today, just so you don’t forget.) The price is only $37 per person includes a fantastic dinner at the Hilton Frontenac at Lindbergh and Highway 40. Plan to arrive by 6:30 p.m. for pre-game conversation.

 

Believe it or not, I plan to talk about the future of the Tea Party movement in America. You should be ready to talk, too. It’s The Discussion Club, not the Speech Club. Think of me as the conversation starter, like a gigantic cigarette lighter or a bowl of freshly picked leaves. Here’s [how the evening progresses](https://www.discussionclub.org/aboutus8.htm):

> The Discussion Club meets at the Hilton Frontenac. Meetings begin with an informal mixer at 6:30 p.m. that provides an excellent opportunity to make new friends. At 7:00 p.m. dinner is served. Speakers normally speak from about 8:00 p.m. to 8:45 p.m., and then we open the floor for comments and questions. In addition to asking the speaker questions about his/her speech, audience members also comment on earlier questions or comments made by other audience members. After approximately 30 minutes the Q&A period ends and the meeting is officially over, but people often chat for long after that with the speaker and with each other.

I am honored by the invitation, and I would be doubly honored by your presence.
