[Ensuring Liberty](https://libertycaucus.net/join.htm) plans to team up with Bachmann, King, and many other conservative House members throughout 2010 and beyond. We want to bring your voices to their ears—again, and again.

 

When you expand this Liberty Caucus on November 3, this forum will be just one way you and Ensuring Liberty can hold our representatives accountable. You can keep these town halls coming by [joining Ensuring Liberty today](https://libertycaucus.net/join.htm).
