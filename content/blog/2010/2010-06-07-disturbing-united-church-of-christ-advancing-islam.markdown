This is disturbing. A St. Louis area “Christian” church, [Parkway United Church of Christ, on N. Ballas](https://www.parkwayucc.org/) is promoting Islam on its sign.

While it’s understandable that a Christian church would treat Muslims as children of God, we are obliged to do so in the context of their prayerful conversion to Christ. Tolerance does not require submission. Yet.

 

As Ms. Behr points out, there are three options for conversion to Islam:*
1. Conversion*
2. Subjugation (be a slave to "the faithful")*
3. Execution

 

Have the people of [Parkway UCC](https://www.parkwayucc.org/) chosen number two? 

 

Most likely this is another example of liberal mania and not a call to conversion to Islam. As Chesterton said, some people are so open-minded that all their brains fall out. 

 

Let’s hope that the Koran quote represents a temporary lapse of judgment. We look forward to reporting that the congregation has replaced the Koran verse with holy scripture.
