](https://www.createspace.com/3417300) A new poll shows [American’s are stressed out](https://apnews.myway.com/article/20100530/D9G1BJFO1.html). Almost half of Americans say they’re under moderate to severe financial stress.

 

I feel it, too. Financially, emotionally, and chronologically.

 

While my book _[Zen Conservatism](https://www.createspace.com/3417300)_ won’t fix all your problems, it will help you deal with what’s going on in America a little better.
