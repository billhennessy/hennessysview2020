It's been almost two years since we met. At the time, I had no idea where this was going. Or what I was doing.

I still don't know what I'm doing, but we all know where America is headed.

Beginning Tuesday, because of your passionate, tireless efforts, America is returning to the right course to meet the destiny our founders envisioned.

On Tuesday, your vote, joined with millions of others, will turn the country around.  Or at least arrest the dangers drift we've been on.

We will elect national candidates like Ed Martin and Roy Blunt.  We'll replace the pro-Obama Auditor with Tom Schweich.  And we'll elect countless qualified State legislators like Paul Curtman, Gary Fuhr, Brian Nieves, and others.

Join us Tuesday evening for a watch party and celebration at 4512 Hampton Avenue, just south of Hampton Village.  We'll have trolley service to Ed Martin's and Gary Fuhr's celebrations.

Thank you for the most amazing journey of my life.  And thank God it's only the beginning.
