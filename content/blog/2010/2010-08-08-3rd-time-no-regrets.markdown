On September 12, we make our third trip to the Arch Steps to rally our spirits and inform our neighbors.

On February 27, 2009, we met for the for first time.  It started a revolution. It disrupted lives.  It promises to change the course of history, the way the great New Madrid Earthquake forever altered the course of the Mississippi River.

Over the past 18 months, we’ve come a long way. We’ve had a few setbacks.  We’ve stumbled. We’ve grown.

In recent weeks, I’ve sensed a renewed sense of optimism and determination as we emerge from The Dip that inevitably hampers an organization’s rise.

Every time I’ve asked, you’ve responded. So I will ask you one more time, perhaps for the last time:



	  * Will you stand with me on the Arch grounds on Sunday, September 12?
	  * Will you wear Red, White, or Blue to symbolize your love of liberty, your acceptance of duty, and your faith in the American Ideal?
	  * Will you come with a full voice and happy, expectant heart, confident that our communion will lead to victory for First Principles in November?
	  * And will you bring you kids and five friends so that they might one day say, “I was there when the American people stood up to tyranny and turned back despotism with power of our faith.”
