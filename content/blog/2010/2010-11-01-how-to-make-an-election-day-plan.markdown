“Winning isn’t everything—it’s the _only_ thing.” -- Bud Wilkinson

Think you can vote without a plan? Maybe you can. Or maybe you’ll get too busy, traffic will be a mess, the weather will turn bad, or your boss will send you on a wild goose chase at 5:30. Without a voting plan, there’s a chance that Missouri will be stuck with a clown like Russ Carnahan. 

 

So let’s make a plan. 

 

A New York Times blog post lays out a scenario in which [Republicans outperform even the rosiest](https://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/31/5-reasons-republicans-could-do-even-better-than-expected/?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter) forecasts. But that can only happen if everyone who’s energized votes. So make a plan. You can do in your head and it only takes a moment.

 

Just answer these questions. If you need to, create an appointment for yourself in your appointment calendar or scheduler. 

 

Voting Plan:

 

**What time of day you do you plan to vote?** Don’t say “whenever I get a chance.” Commit to a time of day and write it down. Make the appointment. And consider these questions when choosing:

 

**Where will you be coming from?** Work? School? Home? Day Care? What will traffic be like? What are the possible barriers?

 

**What will you be doing immediately before voting?** Don’t let anything get in your way. November 2 is no time for casual distractions that prevent you from getting out the door when your planned voting time arrives.

 

**How will you get there?** Consider traffic at that time of day. Is this a route you’re familiar with? Know where you’ll park.

 

And finally, **Who will you bring with you? ** We need as many liberty lovers at the polls as possible. Bring a friend or neighbor, even if it means going to two polling places. Don’t leave our freedom to chance.

 

The polls are positive, but the only poll that counts is the one on November 2, and no one will call you. You need to get out and make liberty happen. 

 

Thank you.
