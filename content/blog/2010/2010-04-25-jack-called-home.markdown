I heard from my son, Jack, tonight for the first time since he left for Navy boot camp on April 14.

 

He is doing well. He survived the first week. He’s been declared fit for full duty. He’s learned to fold things very compactly, to recite the General Orders to the Sentry on command, and to identify his Chain of Command through the President of the United States. 

 

If boot camp hasn’t changed, week two is worse that week one, but I didn’t tell him that. I just let him know not to let little set backs and reprimands bother him. Learn, get better, and move on. We all love him and can’t wait to see him march by in Pass-in-Review.

 

Thanks to the many, many people who passed along their best wishes for Jack at the Tax Day Tea Party. I told him he’d be amazed at all the people cheering for him. 

 

And give my best to your loved ones in the Armed Forces. It’s a tough to make outstanding citizens, and we’re all lucky to have young people willing to protect us.
