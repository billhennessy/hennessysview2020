](https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/paris_vote.jpg) On Tuesday, Missouri becomes the first state in the union to vote on ObamaCare. If being a Tea Partyer means anything, it means you vote Yes on Prop C on Tuesday. I urge not to wing it.

 

Most elections, I wake up and think “it’s election day.” Then I take a shower and go to work. I think about stopping to vote, but I don’t want to walk into the office at 9:00. So I decide to skip out early to vote instead. Then a big meeting pops up late in the day, and I don’t get out until 5:30. Then traffic sucks. Then I stop to get a loaf of bread and decide I need to run home, drop off the bread, change, and _then_ go vote. And I do. But I barely make it, I’m in a long line, and I’m cursing myself for being so unprepared for such a simple task.

 

So here’s what you can do right now to make yourself a far better voter than me. Answer these questions for yourself right now. Write down the questions and answers on a sheet of paper. And keep that paper with you until you’ve voted Tuesday, August 3.

 

**Question One: Do you plan to vote on Tuesday, August 3?**

 

*Yes or no.

 

**Question Two: What time of day do you plan to vote on August 3?**

 

* Morning, Lunch, Afternoon, Evening?

 

**Question Three: Where will you be coming from when you vote on August 3? **

 

* Depends upon time of time, probably, so think about traffic, etc.

 

**Question Four: What will you be doing immediately before voting?**

 

* This is important. If you’re doing something that involves a bunch of kids, for instance, or your dog, what will you do with them while you vote?

 

Missouri’s Secretary of State expects 24 percent turnout statewide. That’s a big jump from the 2008 primaries when only 16 percent voted. Have your plan in place for voting right now. Don’t let circumstances overcome your chance to vote [Yes on Proposition C](https://www.mohealthfreedom.org/) and to decide numerous important primaries.
