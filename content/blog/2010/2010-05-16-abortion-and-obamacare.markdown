In Tennessee and Arizona, insurance exchanges created under ObamaCare are barred from covering abortions. Pro-life groups claim this trend will continue as more states realize that the bill passed earlier this year allows states to block abortion coverage by private exchanges. (Missouri’s legislature sent a similar measure to Gov. Jay Nixon.)

Pro-abortion members of Congress are incensed, according to the [Associated Press and Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/05/16/abortion-opponents-capitalizing-new-health-care-law/):

> "Implementation of this reform should be about increasing access to health care and increasing choices, not taking them away," said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., a member of the Senate leadership.

Expect the White House to close this loop with strong-arm tactics. When insurance companies discovered that ObamaCare permitted insurance companies to exclude children with pre-existing conditions, HHS Secretary [Kathleen Sebelius simply dictated](https://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303410404575152100463512126.html) the loophole closed. Sheepish insurance companies yielded.

 

Dictatorships _are_ efficient. They are also inhumane.
