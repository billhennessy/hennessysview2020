Tonight at Victory Center, the phones were packed with volunteers, and it made a difference. We made over 1,600 calls and canvassers visited over 200 homes. But it gets better.

Because of the energy and enthusiasm in the room, the quality of the calls was fantastic. Veteran callers said that the people they spoke to were more engaged and pleasant than on past nights. That’s because success and energy drives enthusiasm, which people respond to even over the phone. 

 

**But we’re only beginning. **

 

We need to have our phone bank packed 6 days a week. And that’s where you come in. 

 

If you believe that the Tea Party movement is more than just a rally, then we need you to help make difference on election day. That means getting involved before election day. [![TeaPartyHQ](https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/TeaPartyHQ_thumb.jpg)

Over 40,000 people have attended Tea Party events in the St. Louis area since February 27, 2009. If each of them give just one hour between now and election day, we will be able to claim victory—in Missouri’s 3rd District and across the state.

 

Moreover, we’ll be able to build a permanent, conservative grassroots operation to keep the momentum going.

 

So, please, do this right now. Mark on a calendar the hour you will come down to the HQ. Decide whether you want to go door to door, make calls, or take part in a corner lit drop. (If going door to door, please start before 5:30 pm so you can finish before dark.)

 

We are here at 4512 Hampton Avenue Monday through Friday, 10 am to 8 pm, and Saturdays 10am to 3pm. Those hours will only expand as we approach the most important election of our lifetimes.

 

Please come down and help us restore the republic, just as pledged to do on the steps of the Arch last year.
