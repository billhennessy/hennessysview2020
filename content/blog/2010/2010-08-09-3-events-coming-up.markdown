[![calendar_of_events[1]](https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/calendar_of_events1_thumb.jpg)
](https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/calendar_of_events1.jpg)I am very honored by the invitations I get to speak to various clubs and organizations around Greater St. Louis, including Illinois. This August, I have the chance to meet two groups and to guest host a radio show.

 

On August 18, I’ll speak to the [Meramec Township Republican Committee](https://www.facebook.com/pages/MERAMEC-TOWNSHIP-REPUBLICAN-CLUB/115431625145332). 

 

On August 26, I’ll be speaking at the [North County Republican Club](https://northcountyrepublicans.org/) meeting at Yac’s Restaurant at 407 Dunn Rd. in Florissant.

 

But even before all that, Dr. Gina Loudon has asked me to [guest-host her wonderful new radio show](https://www.crawfordbroadcasting.com/~kjsl/drgina.htm) on [TruthTalk 630 AM](https://www.crawfordbroadcasting.com/~kjsl/index.htm) this Wednesday, August 11, from 4 to 6 p.m. I am still working on my guests, but please listen in.
