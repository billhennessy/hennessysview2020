](https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/playboy.jpg) The Tea Party phenomenon has been with us for almost a year and a half already. We _finally_ made it to the pages of America’s most venerable . . . um, girly magazine. 

 

_[Rogues of K Street](https://www.playboy.com/articles/rogues-of-k-street) _is an anonymous Washington insider’s view of the most effective and expansive political movement in at least half a century. 

 

While the author may have overstated my contributions to the cause, the expose is important for historical purposes. These are the observations of a Washington political pro. This is how Washington views the movement, not how we or our enemies define us. In that, it is perhaps the most honest portrayal of the movement to date. 

 

Whatever your views of the magazine, [this article deserves your eyes and thoughts](https://www.playboy.com/articles/rogues-of-k-street). Take a look. When you make history, every quarter must notice.
