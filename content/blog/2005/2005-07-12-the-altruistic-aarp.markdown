Regular readers might expect me to rant against the AARP, as I at least monthly.  But this time, their altruism is commendable.

By [endorsing euthenasia for the elderly,](https://marlowesshade.blogspot.com/2005/07/aarp-paves-way-for-euthanasia.html) the AARP has admitted that it serves no worthwhile purpose and must be put to sleep.

Certainly, just disbanding would be the moral thing to do.  But if the AARP insists on disbanding by suicide, who am I to get their way?
