[Backcountry Conservative](https://www.jquinton.com/archives/002356.html) has a worth-reading piece on Armstrong Williams' brother, Kent, who took his seat in the South Carolina Senate last week.




Armstrong says his brother is a good conservative who could not hope to win running as a Republican in that district. Good for Kent and for the people of his district. Party affiliation isn't as important as core beliefs, and Kent Williams's core seems as solid as a rock.
