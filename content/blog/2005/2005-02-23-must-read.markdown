[Ed Morrissey's smack down ](https://www.captainsquartersblog.com/mt/archives/003902.php)of Ted Rall is wonderful, uplifting, heart-happying. Read it before your next cup of coffee.




Relish the way lefty Rall views people with regular jobs. The sneer, the smugness, the inuendo. How DARE a plebian attempt to think!




I see Rall standing in some old building at Harvard looking out at the blogosphere the way Mel Gibson presented Cornwallis's surrender. "Everything will change, now."




Hat tip [Michelle Malkin](https://michellemalkin.com/archives/001577.htm).




UPDATE: I should have read Captain Ed's links before I posted.[ QandO tears Ted Rall ](https://www.qando.net/details.aspx?Entry=1204)to shreds, exposing some lies. (Apologies to [Dean Esmay](https://www.deanesmay.com/posts/1109146224.shtml).) You get the feeling that Ted Rall's dog regards his master the way Grinch's dog, Max, regarded his.
