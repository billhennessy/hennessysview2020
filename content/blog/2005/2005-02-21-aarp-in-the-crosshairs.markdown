[Its about time](https://www.themoderatevoice.com/posts/1109013509.shtml). Joe Gandelman points out that the people who brought you the Swift Vets are taking aim on the AARPa corrupt, leftist organization committed to stealing from the young and giving to the old whilst limiting freedom for everyone and outlawing cell phones.




I despise the [AARP ](https://blog.billhennessy.com/blogs/hennessys_view/archive/2005/02/15/William.aspx)and everything it stands for, particularly its blogroll. (Find it yourselfIm not providing a link to the wealthy old bastards.)




UPDATE: The spineless weasels took down their Blogroll. It's not there. Even a search of their site will not find it. I e-mailed the org, asking why they took it down--like they'll ever answer me. Organized Old People are just as dangerous as organized crime.




UPDATE: Well, I apologize. USA Next's first attempt at attacking AARP was misguided, inappropriate, offensive, and counterproductive. They'd have accomplished more by sending AARP a $100,000 donation. [ Dean Esmay ](https://www.deanesmay.com/posts/1109101301.shtml)has a good description.
