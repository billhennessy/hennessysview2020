Amy Ridenour points a UK Guardian article explaining why Global Warming is responsible for Global Cooling.  But Amy, unlike the Guardian, goes on to point out that the sun has more to do with global temperature than man does.

UPDATE:  I've added [Amy's blog ](https://www.nationalcenter.org/Blog.html)to my blog roll.  Therefore, you are all obliged to read it at least once a week.
