Some highlights:

It will take "years" to recover from Katrina.
Government allows fuel blends immediately to reduce cost of gasoline.
Victims will be overwhelmed with Americans' desire to help.
I am confident that with time you'll get your life back in order . . . the great city of New Orleans will be back on its feet.

Some Thoughts:

Let's go to a 10 hour per day, 4 day work week.   There is no excuse for people to drive to work 5 days a week at this point, and 10 hour days won't hurt anyone.

Let's encourage Americans to stay within 50 miles of home this Labor Day weekend.  We can visit distant relatives and amusement parks when things stabalize.

Let's find a home for every person who needs one.

Let's overwhelm them with love, mercy, and generosity.
