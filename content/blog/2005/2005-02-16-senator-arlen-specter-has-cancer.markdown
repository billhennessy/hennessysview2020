UPDATE: I know I typed this before, but, somehow, it didn't get saved:




I've had my disagreements with Senator Specter, but so has the left. Feminists still seeth over his valient defense of Clarence Thomas.   
  
For the most part, when justice or his party really needed him, he's shown up.   
  
I wish him the best. As does [Dean Esmay](https://www.deanesmay.com/posts/1108605885.shtml). And [K-Lo](https://www.nationalreview.com/thecorner/05_02_13_corner-archive.asp#056399)
