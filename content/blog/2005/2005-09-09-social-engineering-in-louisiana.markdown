You see them.  They're knocking each other down to blame Katrina and its aftermath on Bush.  They're lying, of course.  They're Democrats; they can't help themselves.

Genius isn't required to see that the relief efforts in Republican-conrolled Mississippi, with far more storm damage than Louisiana, is relatively smooth.  Like Florida's Jeb Bush, Haley Barbour seems to know what he's doing.

Next door in Louisiana, there's  another story.  Democrat run, Democrat destroyed Louisiana is a shambles.  Each day, we learn why:

The Democrat Governor of Louisiana refused to feed evacuees in the Super Dome.  Applying operant conditioning in a way normally used on theme park animals, Governor Blanco reasoned that if authorities gave food and water to the 20,000 people in the Super Dome and the 10,000 folks at the convention center, they'd be inclined to stay.  As usual, a Democrat figured she knows better than the people.  Let a few dozen of them die, get raped, murdered, and beat-up, then they'll want to leave.

Who said so?  Well, the [Red Cross ](https://www.redcross.org/faq/0,1096,0_682_4524,00.html)and the Salvation Army said so:



> Acess to New Orleans is controlled by the National Guard and local authorities and while we are in constant contact with them, we simply cannot enter New Orleans against their orders.

The state Homeland Security Department had requested--and continues to request--that the American Red Cross not come back into New Orleans following the hurricane. Our presence would keep people from evacuating and encourage others to come into the city. 



FoxNews confirms that it was the Louisiana State Department of Homeland Security, not the USDHS, which ordered the Super Dome starved out.  Of course, that fact doesn't stop[ trained liar SteveRose ](https://www.dailykos.com/story/2005/9/2/2125/04978)from whopping up the natives on DailyKos, where he conveniently leaves out the word "state" from the Red Cross memo so that he can lie to the idiots who adore him, blaming the order on the Bush administration.

In her petty little sociology experiment, Blanco refused to allow the Red Cross, the Salvation Army, or the National Guard to feed the starving, dehydrating citizens of Louisiana.  She turned them all into Terri Schiavos, killing them for their own good.



> One doctor told the Associated Press, "There are entire hospitals that are contacting me, saying, 'We need to take on patients,' but they can't get through the bureaucracy. The crime of this story is, you've got millions of dollars in assets and it's not deployed. We mount a better response in a Third World country."



Governor Blanco will sleep well, though.  To the Democrat mind, it's okay to kill Americans in pursuit of a social goal.  Like Hitler and Stalin, today's Democrats are, at their hearts, social engineers hoping to perfect humanity by killing the imperfect.
