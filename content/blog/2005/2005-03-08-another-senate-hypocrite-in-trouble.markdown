Senator John McCain, the Keating Five escapee who put his name on a bill intended to destroy the First Amendment, has been caught with his hand in the till.




According to the[ Associated Press](https://apnews.myway.com/article/20050308/D88MFUN00.html), one of the few organizations that stands to gain politically under McCain-Feingold, the Senator and former POW pressed for pricing changes on behalf of Cablevision while soliciting $200,000 from Cablevision for one of McCain's tax-exempt political action committees, The Reform Institute.

Teddy Kennedy praises Bush's foreign policy, Syria backs up in Lebanon, Michelle Malkin posts a hot new photo, the BTK killer is depressed, Robert Byrd is proven a hypocrite, Ward Churchill's life's in shambles, and, now, the AP is taking down John McCain--looks like Ronald Reagan's finished his in-processing in Heaven and has gotten down to business.
