[An Associated Press poll ](https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6833513/)finds Americans clearly hopeful for the next four years. They also show remarkable, though understandable, confidence in Bush's character.




Money quote: "Almost two-thirds of those polled described Bush as likable, strong and intelligent. A majority said he is dependable and honest."
