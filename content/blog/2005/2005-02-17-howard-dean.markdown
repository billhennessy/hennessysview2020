Here we are half a week into Dean's chairmanship, and the Democrats still don't control Congress. 




He has, though, picked up the rhetoric bulls**t where he dropped off when the loser, Kerry, kicked his lilly-white rearend out of the DNC primaries. He demanded that a[ GOP state chairman resign ](https://www.nationalreview.com/beltway/056387.html)for making a rather innocuous observation, to wit:




> 

> 
> The Democrats simply have refused to learn the lessons of the past two election cycles, and now they can be accurately called the party of Barbara Boxer, Lynne Stewart and Howard Dean.
> 
> 




Last Friday, Dean told the Congressional Socialist-Democrat Black Caucaus that the only blacks at a GOP meeting are the hotel help. (More or less.) Still, that pretty lame for most irresponsible speaker in the United States.




Moreover, the press is ignoring him, which surprises me. Oh, yeah, there's the odd story here and there, but nothing like the kind of coverage I was expected:




BREAKING NEWS: HOWARD DEAN WEARS DONKEY NECKTIE TO COCKTAIL PARTY




None of that nonsense. Perhaps the press knows that, for Howard Dean, the only bad exposure is any exposure. 




While the MSM is leaving him alone, the right is not. [ Jonah Goldberg points out](https://www.nationalreview.com/goldberg/goldberg200502161204.asp),

For the record, a lot of people hate Howard Dean and everything he stands for. And those who hate him just won a national election billed as the most important in a lifetime. 




I guess we won't hear anything about Dean from the MSM until Dean stops saying idiotic things. And we all know that will happen only when he's six feet under. 




Obviously, though,[ Joe Gandelman disagrees with me 100%.](https://www.themoderatevoice.com/posts/1108594100.shtml) So does Hugh Hewitt, apparently. Hey, fellas, read Jonah's piece,[ read Dean's long trail of hatred and rage](https://www.rightwingnews.com/archives/week_2005_02_13.PHP#003470) on Right Wing News, then rethink your positions.




Here's more on [The American Thinker](https://www.americanthinker.com/comments.php?comments_id=1636). Follow the links (you'll have to register), and you'll soon realize that Gandelman and Hewitt are flat out wrong on this one. They should have done their homework before sucking up to Howard Dean. American Thinker also let me to the [Byron York piece on NRO ](https://www.nationalreview.com/york/york200502170843.asp)showing that George Soros's money is defending Stewart.

Nuff said. Except for [this on Ipse Dixit](https://www.cdharris.net/archives/2005_02.html#004349) and [Bill InDC has more](https://www.indcjournal.com/archives/001570.php)
