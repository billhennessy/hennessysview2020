Before I ever heard the term blogging, I published three 500-750 word columns a week on my old website. That started in 1999. Work and other things became too demanding, so I let it lapse in 2001. This blog began about two years ago, but I got serious on December 15, 2003. I'll mark that as my anniversary. It was the Monday after Saddam fell (crawled) into US custody.




Two gentlemen have been too kind to me in the past year. I must tip my cap to [Steven Taylor ](https://www.poliblogger.com/)and [Dean Esmay](https://www.deanesmay.com/). Dozens of others have been kind enough to comment, e-mail, or link. Thanks to you, too.




Finally, a couple of years ago, before I met the most wonderful woman in the world, I would have been out shootin' it on a Friday night, especially Mardi Gras weekend. But here I sit at my Compaq Evo 800 blogging. So I have to thank my wife, the tree-hugging, clog-wearing, self-described bleeding-heart liberal. I know I'm too harsh sometimes--she never is. I have no doubt that if all "liberals" were like my bride, liberalism would achieve world hegemony. But it takes only one jerk to screw it all up, so we need us righties to keep the bad guys at bay. 




Anyway, thank you, blogosphere. It's been a very good year. 




Cordially,  
Bill Hennessy
