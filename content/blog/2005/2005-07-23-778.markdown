The National Cancer Institute funded a Chinese study that links induced abortion to a signficantly increased risk of breast cancer.  But the results were politically incorrect, so the NCI buried the study, according to [Purposeful Dreamer](https://anniebanno.blogspot.com/2005/07/deep-sixed-2000-china-abortionbreast.html).

It appears, now, the NCI is removing all copies of the study from the internet in a Soviet-style attempt to whitewash history.  Still, pdf copies remain, and [here is a link to one.](https://web.archive.org/web/20041031182631/https://www.epiresearch.org/meeting_03/abstractbook.pdf)

(H/T to [AfterAbortion](https://afterabortion.blogspot.com/2005/07/deep-sixed-2000-china-abortionbreast.html).)

Please e-mail NCI and tell them you demand they release this study and warn women that induced abortions increases the risk of breast cancer.

Here is the[ NCI's online e-mail form](https://www.cancer.gov/contact).
