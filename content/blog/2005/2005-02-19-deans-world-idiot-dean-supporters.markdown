[Dean's World  ](https://www.deanesmay.com/posts/1108836309.shtml)noticed that a Howard Dean support threw a shoe at Richard Perle when Perle began speaking at debate against Howard in Oregon yesterday.




Joe Gandelman, guest blogger, asks several questions about the mental state of the person who threw the shoe. But this is typical Deaniac behavior. Its why [Dr. Dean wanted no press ](https://blog.billhennessy.com/blogs/hennessys_view/archive/2005/02/17/1113.aspx)at the affair. His side has nothing to say, save for we have more shoes than we need, so you take some.
