Thanks to [Katherine Lopez at NRO The Corner](https://corner.nationalreview.com/05_12_11_corner-archive.asp#084635), I learned a valuable lesson that all Catholics should heed:  The true meaning of Christmas is about increasing the minimum wage.

Let's hope Ted Kennedy's theological insights make to the Vatican before the Pope writes his homily for Midnight Mass.  We'd hate to mis-catechize the Christian world by talking about Jesus when Christmas is really about hourly wages, health insurance, and campaign contributions from unions.

From the Democrat press release:



> Senator Edward Kennedy (D-MA), Reps. Steny Hoyer (D-MD) and George Miller (D-CA) will stand before the Capitol Christmas Tree on Wednesday to discuss the true meaning of Christmas: hope, generosity, and goodwill toward others. In this spirit, the lawmakers will call on Congress to raise the national minimum wage before leaving for the year. They will release a report from the Center for Economic and Policy Research detailing the difficulty that families living on the minimum wage have in making ends meet. 



Hallelujah!
