(Sorry-- left out the NYC when I originally posted.)

From the "you can't this stuff up" pile:



> A Bronx teacher who repeatedly flunked his state certification exam paid a formerly homeless man with a developmental disorder $2 to take the test for him, authorities said yesterday.



But it gets better.  What made authorities suspicious was that the homeless guy scored so much higher than the teacher ever scored they knew something was amiss.

The homeless guy:


> "I gave him my all," said Leitner, 58, who suffers from Asperger's syndrome, a disorder similar to autism. "He gave me what he thought I was worth."



Wow.  Wow, wow. wow.  My opinion--the kids in New York would be better off with the Asperger's guy teaching them.
