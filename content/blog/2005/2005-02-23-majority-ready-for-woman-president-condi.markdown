I saw this several placed yesterday, but [OTB](https://www.outsidethebeltway.com/archives/9359) has the write up that made me read. While I'm not quite ready to jump on the Condi 08 bandwagon just yet, this is a very encouraging story for those who have. For obvious reasons, I think it most likely that our first female president and our first black president will come from the party viewed as the more conservative. If you're going to tear down walls, might as well kill two archaic birds with one stone, right?
