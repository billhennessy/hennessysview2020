[Steven Taylor ](https://www.poliblogger.com/index.php?p=6298)rightly predicts that today's top story will be the [Washington Post ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A45323-2005Feb22.html?referrer=email)report that the White House redacted the whole of the report on Iraq's economy from last week's economic report.




The story claims that the good news about Iraq's economy would be inappropriate at a time when so many security problems exist. That rings hollow. The President could use some good news in his European trip, and the whole world could use some good news about Iraq.




While I usually admonish administrations to stick to their guns, in this case, I feel inclined to encourage the White House to release whatever was removed. The American people are a hearty bunch and can usually handle the truth--even when it's good news.
