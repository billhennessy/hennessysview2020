The hosting provider I have used since May of last year was unabled to provide even minimal levels of service over the past month. As a result, the owner of that company decided to end its hosting business. Coincidentally, I saw his notice of termination while I was e-mailing him to let him know that I'd given up on his company's ability to provide web hosting service.




Last night and tonight, I moved four large applications from the old provider to the new one, WebHost4Life.com. The new provider comes with strong recommendations.




I know a lot of people are tired of the constant slow performance and frequent downtime of this site. I am sorry. It has been very difficult three months for me as I have tried to develop websites and manage customers on servers that performed like 486s in de-turbo mode.




Things should be much better here on out.




And I'll have much more time to blog . . .
