All the world seems in tune
On a spring afternoon
As we murder a fetus in the womb.

Maybe we'll do-in
A newborn to two-when
We murder a fetus in the womb.

We'll slaughter them all amid
Laughter and merriment
Except for the few
We take home to experiment.

Yes, the sun's shining bright,
Everything seems alright
As we murder a fetus in the womb.

We've gained notoriety
And caused much anxiety
In the Vitae Society
With our games.

They call it "Impiety"
And "lack of propriety"
And quite a variety
Of unpleasant names.

But it's protected by Corpus Habeae
To want to dispose of a ba-bay.

So if Sunday you're free
Why donÂ’t you come with me
And we'll slaughter a baby in the womb.

We'll chop it with rotors
And flip off the voters
When we murder a baby in the womb.

When mom sees an ultrasound
She thinks it's infanticide
But with new legislation
Her worries will soon subside.

Yes, we're cheering the law
As we suck out its jaw
After killing a baby in the womb.
