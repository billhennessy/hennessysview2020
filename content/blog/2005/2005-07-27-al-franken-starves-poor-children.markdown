So it appears.  According to [Michelle Malkin](https://michellemalkin.com/archives/003117.htm), [Ed Morrissey](https://www.captainsquartersblog.com/mt/archives/005053.php), [Brian Maloney](https://radioequalizer.blogspot.com/2005/07/federal-funds-diverted-to-air-america.html), [The Bronx News](https://www.gothamgazette.com/community/12/news/1733), and other sources, several federally supported relief agencies in New York have been illegally funelling hundreds of thousands of dollars to Al Franken's anti-American radio network Air America.

The agencies in question, [Gloria Wise Boys & Girls Club ](https://www.gloriawise.com/main.asp?id=4)and Pathways for Youth Boys & Girls clubs.



> One source told the News that $480,000 in funds from the Gloria Wise Club is involved in the cityÂ’s investigation of illegal transfer of funds from the local club.



Michelle rightly questions the integrity of the New York Times, which has failed, so far, to mention this travesty.  More than likely, NYT editors skim money from Bangladeshi relief funds to fill the tanks of their Hummers.



> The money, which was reportedly paid to Air America as a loan, was supposed to be paid back with interest, two unidentified informed sources told the News. One source added that Air America officials, led by an official of the Gloria Wise Club, agreed to help the local club by publicizing its activities.



I'm sure Air America's satanic choir will mount the usual defense:  pass the buck and attack the good people.

First, they'll claim that Air America's communist agenda will help poor people in the long run, so if a few starve to death in the process, it'll all be worth it.  ("What's one life compared to this great revolution, comrade?")

Next, they'll blame youth poverty on imaginary Bush spending cuts which never, ever happened.  (Did you know that education spending, for instance, is growing faster under Bush 43 than under any recent President?  Probably not, since the media won't tell you the truth to save their lives.)

Then, they'll say they are being persecuted by right-wing Bushco agents who just want to suppress the voice of the people.

Finally, they'll appeal to our intellects by telling us they'd have plenty of money if Americans weren't so stupid, bigotted, arrogant, anti-intellectual, low-brow, violent, evil, and preoccupied with smelling good.  (In other words, not French.)

Since no one who can count to 5 listens to Air America, they're stealing lunch money from the poor to line their already fat wallets.  God have mercy on them, and grant me the graces to have mercy on them, too.    Right now, I'm finding it in short supply.

If you want to tell Air America to stop stealing from the poor, you can [e-mail them here](https://shows.airamericaradio.com/contact)

**UPDATE**  I e-mailed this entry to every show on their schedule.  I also posted it to several of the [shows' blogs.](https://shows.airamericaradio.com/alfrankenshow/node/3034)  Unfortunately, Err America's web site is so chopped up that moving from one blog to another is a pain.  Further, the site, so far as I can tell, has no aggregator--you have to navigate to each show, then to the show's blog, blah blah.  It's the web in 1994.  Anyway, please join the fray.  They'll have to mention this scandal at some point.
