Let me get this straight: this guys having a tough time personally, then a sermon ticks him off. He gets his gun, goes to church, and kills a bunch of people, then himself.




Sounds like Muslim fundamentalist.




But, no, its more like a Christian fundamentalist church. And the reverend apparently didnt cajole the congregation to kill heathen. Instead, the preacher is a eschatologist who predicted the end is near, which eschatologists do for a living.

I dont know if the Bible says anything about lots of shooting rampages preceding the end of time, but if it does, Meredith might be onto something. Three ([here) ](https://michellemalkin.com/archives/001765.htm)in one week. Four if you count last Fridays double homicide in a wealthy St. Louis suburb.
