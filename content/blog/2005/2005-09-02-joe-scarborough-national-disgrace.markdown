Police looting for food.  People starving to death.   The first of the Red Cross aid arrived in Biloxi, Mississippi only tonight, four days after the hurricane.  Scarborough says he's been involved in many hurricane relief efforts, and he's never seen one this unresponsive.

In New Orleans, there are very few Guardsmen, police, doctors visible.  Several doctors left the Super Dome, unable to treat people because of the violence.  One doctor reported the problem of the bodies of murder victims:  four Wednesday night, four Tuesday, maybe more.  Murder.  That's not to mention those who died from the extreme conditions.  The doctor treated dozens of rape victims and even more attempted rape victims.

The news agencies have hired private security forces so they can cover the story, so absent is any form of police protection.  A senior law enforcement officer told a FoxNews reporter, "No one's in charge."

Listening to pleas of people who haven't eaten in 5 days, who are drinking flood water, tears your heart out.  It's sickening and depraved, and there is no excuse for it.  None.

The Red Cross is silent.

The federal government is silent.

Louisiana's government is silent.

Only the cries of starving infants rise above the stench of a dying city.  Only the shouts of anger from stranded victims who have not seen a single authority figure except for the gangs.

We better pray that God sends the Holy Spirit quickly to soften the hearts of the vicitms.  A great torrent of vindictive hatred brews in America's south tonight.  It's a hatred that will demand an outlet.  No man can quell their rage, but God can.  All of humanity lacks the mercy needed to fix the problem we, in our smug wealth, have created.

God have mercy on us all.

> I think it puts into question all of the Homeland Security and Northern Command planning for the last four years, because if we cant respond faster than this to an event we saw coming across the gulf for days, then why do we think were prepared to respond to a nuclear or biological attack? said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
