[Steven Taylor ](https://www.poliblogger.com/index.php?p=6280)on Poliblog found[ the BBC story ](https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4282333.stm)that Ruud Lubbers, the UN Refugee Head, resigned. 




Yesterday,[ I blogged](https://blog.billhennessy.com/blogs/hennessys_view/archive/2005/02/19/1132.aspx) on a New York Times story that Lubbers would not resign, calling the numerous sexual harassment changes against him "lies." That story also reported that Kofi Annan planned to seek legal advice on the matter over the weekend. Apparently, Lubbers felt the heat.




It looks like the UN's closet door is open, and the skeletons are shaking out. How soon before one of the UN's scandal casualties turns on Annan and others? Pop some corn, throw a log on the fire and watch them burn each other.
