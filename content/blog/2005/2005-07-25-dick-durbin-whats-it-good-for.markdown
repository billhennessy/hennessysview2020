We know that Dick Durbin hates members of the US Armed Forces.  We know that he hates personal property and freedom.  Now we learn how much he hates unborn children.  From [Jay Anderson](https://proecclesia.blogspot.com/2005/07/durbin-pro-life-stance-would.html), via [NewsMax](https://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2005/7/24/114739.shtml), via [NBC](https://www.msnbc.msn.com/), we learn Durbin considers being pro-life as a disqualifying defect for any judge.

I wonder how many abortions his wife and children account for?  After all, if abortions are such wonderful things, wouldn't he want the women he loves have a few?
