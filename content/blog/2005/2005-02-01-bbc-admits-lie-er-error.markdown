[The BBC admits ](https://news.bbc.co.uk/newswatch/ifs/hi/newsid_4220000/newsid_4222300/4222353.stm)that it was wrong when it claimed coalition forces had killed more Iraqi civilians than had all other factors combined in the history of the country. Well, they didn't claim that, exactly, but if the BBC can irresponsibly hyperbolize facts in order to promoted its twisted, anti-Western, pro-terrorist viewpoints, why can't we?
