According to roving Hollywood reporter, Mike Evans, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's popularity is now at 68%, six points higher than Ronald Reagan's all-time high.




I didn't think he'd run, then I didn't think he'd win, then I wasn't sure how well he'd do. But I have to admit, this guy seems to have been born to run the state of California. He's been on top of the polls for over a year now--probably the most popular governor of any state in the country over that period.




Congrats, Arnold. Agree or disagree with your policies, for now, you've got it on the ball.
