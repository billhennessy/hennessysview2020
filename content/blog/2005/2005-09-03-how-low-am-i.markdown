In fleeting delusions of vainglory, I have seen myself as a good man.

No more.

The e-mails and messages I have receives through www.katrinahomes.info have convinced me that I am a wretch.  I don't deserve to correspond with many of the people registering and e-mailing that site.  I am not worthy to meet the people in the Gulf states looking for their children amidst the debris.  I am not worthy of task God has set upon my shoulders.  But I know He, not me, will carry it to fruition.

Thank you, Lord.  Thank you, America.  I am such a nothing in a such sea of wonder.
