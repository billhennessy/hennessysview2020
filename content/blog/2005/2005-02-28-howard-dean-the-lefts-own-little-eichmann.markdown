Okay, I know I'm not a genius like the mad doctor from Vermont, but could someone explain the logic of Dean's latest idiotic blusterfest?




On the one hand, he extolls (kind of) the virtues of "tolerance":

"Moderate Republicans can't stand these people (conservatives), because they're intolerant. They don't think tolerance is a virtue," Dean said, adding: "I'm not going to have these right-wingers throw away our right to be tolerant."

And immediately delcares that anyone who disagree with Democrats is "evil":

And concluding his backyard speech with a litany of Democratic values, he added: "This is a struggle of good and evil. And we're the good."

But Dean is tolerant of evil, much like the Germans who "didn't know." So Dean exemplifies Edmund Burke's conclusion that "All that is necessary for evil to succeed is that good men do nothing." Since lefties won't read Burke, Einstein said something similar: "The world is a dangerous place, not because of those who do evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing."




By promoting tolerance for evil, Dean promotes evil.




Therefore, Dean is either evil or an idiot. (For the record, I think he's just an idiot.)
