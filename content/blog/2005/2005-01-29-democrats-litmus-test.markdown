[MyDD blog has a very good analysis of his party's relationship ](https://www.mydd.com/story/2005/1/24/25546/0124)to labor vis a vis other liberal causes. I like to think of labor unions as applied liberalism, and academic liberalism (causes) as theoretical or pure liberalism. Having grown up in very pro-labor neighborhood of South St. Louis, I have soft spot for guys like this.
