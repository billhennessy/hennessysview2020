About two months ago, right around Christmas, a silly little girl who attends some college somewhere in Pennsylvania sent me a nasty, mean e-mail. She had read something I wrote about the United Nations. Her college indoctrinators had convinced her that the only to achieve anything close to justice in the world is to dissolve all governments save for the the UN.




Well, little girl who was too shy to pen her name, if you saw[ ABC's 20/20 ](https://abcnews.go.com/2020/UnitedNations/story?id=489306&page=1)tonight, you learned a little about that wonderful institution. 




> 

> 
> **Widespread allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse of Congolese women, boys and girls have been made against U.N. personnel who were sent to help and protect them  despite a so-called zero tolerance policy touted by the United Nations toward such behavior.**
> 
> 




We learned in the report that one man, Didier Bourguet, was shocked--shocked--that the United Nations had a policy against raping little girls. Hell, he's been doing it for years, and he wasn't trying to keep it a secret. For crying out loud, that's why people like Didier work for the UN. The little girls. The pre-mences tots with curly hair who never expect you to stay the night or sleep on the wet spot.

> **"We have heard cases where they have traded eggs for sex or bread for sex or a jar of peanut butter for sex," said Van Woudenberg. "These are not people who have very much. So they hang around the outskirts of these U.N. bases in order to try and get a handout, a little food. Maybe they can sell some bananas or some peanuts. And it has become not uncommon that peacekeepers invite these girls in  and of course the younger the better, because there's less chance that they will be infected by HIV/AIDS."**

Ah, yes, that wonderful bastion of humanitarianism. That defender of downtrodden communist regimes. And, still, the UN will not intervene in Sudan.

> **Aimee Tsesi, of Bunia, said her 15-year-old deaf mute daughter was raped and impregnated by a U.N. soldier from Uruguay, and that she was turned away at the gates of the U.N. camp when she went for assistance.**

I'm sorry, little girl in Pennsylvania, but your professors lie to you. The authors of your textbooks lie to you. The members of your feminist club and your peace through weakness club and all your other clubs lie to you. The United Nations is an evil organization comprised mostly of cruel, women-hating dictators who kill little babies for sport. The United Nations stands for peace, but only after the fire of freedom has safely been extinguished.

> **To date, of the hundreds of allegations of sex crimes involving U.N. personnel, only two have faced any kind of prosecution.**
