When I started writing in 1993, I assumed that at some point I would do it for a living.  I did for a short time in 1995, but it was a pretty meager living.  In 1999, I wrote a little ASP application that would allow me to write a few columns a week at my leisure.  Soon, I found myself a single father, though, and had no time to write.

Last year the world overflowed with both beauty and ugliness.  I could not hold my tongue--or my keyboard--any longer.  Blogging seemed to be the perfect medium for me, so I jumped in.

As problems mounted, so did my hours at the keyboard.  Those hours, though, come from a fixed allotment of time and something else had to give.  What gave were those multitudinous little commitments that we implicitly made to the most important people in our lives:  wives and kids.

Were there some return, other than various satisfactions, in blogging, I would not be writing this.  There are not.  As with so many things, blogging is a numbers game.  I drive up my readership only by increasing my hours.  The writing isn't as time consuming as the linking.

First things coming first, the three hours a day I've devoted to this work will now go into other, private endeavors.  If time permits, I may post a single column-length piece each week. I will no longer maintain a running blog.

I must thank the people who have been most generous and enjoyable:  Michelle of[ Right in Texas](https://rightintx.blogspot.com), [Michelle Malkin](https://michellemalkin.com), Beth of [My Vast Right Wing Conspiracy](https://bamapachyderm.com), Steven Taylor of [Poliblog](https://www.poliblogger.com), [Captain Ed](https://www.captainsquartersblog.com/mt/), James Joyner of [OTB](https://www.outsidethebeltway.com), Jim Paine at [PirateBallerina](https://www.pirateballerina.com/index.php), [Dean Esmay](https://www.deanesmay.com), [Joe Gandelman](https://themoderatevoice.com/), [CollegePundit](https://collegepundit.blogspot.com), Political Teen, [GOP Bloggers ](https://www.gopbloggers.com)and [Blogs for Bush](https://www.blogsforbush.com), [Blogs for Terri](https://www.blogsforterri.com), and all the others.

Keep fighting the good fight.  I'll keep an eye out.

UPDATE:  I can't believe I forgot [Professor Bainbridge](https://www.professorbainbridge.com).
UPDATE:  I forgot [WuzzaDem](https://www.wuzzadem.com/), too.  (This why people should avoid naming people to thank.)
