Yes, this is too easy with the headlines that US and Iraqi troops have just missed him two or three times in the past two weeks. But I have a soft stop for gut things, and George Bush is on a roll.





  * First, Condi and Gonzalez have been confirmed. 
  * The stock market continues to improve.
  * The State of the Union address was the best he's given so far.
  * The Iraqi elections were an overwhelming success.
  * Afghanistan is a democracy.
  * Social Security reform seems probable as the Democrat demogoguery has eased since last night.
  * Saddam's trial will begin soon.


You put all of these things together and they add up to a winning streak for the POTUS. Zarqawi will fall soon.




Bin Laden, though, seems to be another story. I suspect he is safe so long as he stays in Pakistan.
