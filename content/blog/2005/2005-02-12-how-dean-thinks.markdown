Want to know how Howard Dean thinks?

Ponder that a moment.




The man who wanted to be chief executive of the modern world's first democratic republic wrote on [January 10, 2005](https://www.democracyforamerica.com/features/2005/01/10/keep_the_election_on_track.php), that he believes Iraqis deserve some sort of managed democracy in which votes are only marginally important.




Instead of letting the people, who can't be trusted in Dean's view, to decide affairs, Dean would have a team of fairness experts decide how to apportion seats in the Iraqi legislature.




Given the chance, Dr. Dean would visit the horrors of a centralized planning agency on America, as well. Miles separate Dean's idea of democracy and self-determination from the common understanding of our founders and the philosophers they embraced.
