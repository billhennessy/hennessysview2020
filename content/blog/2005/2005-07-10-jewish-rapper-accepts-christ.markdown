According to [Religious News Service and Christian News](https://www.religionjournal.com/showarticle.asp?id=2794), Jewish satirical rapper, 50 Shekel, after viewing Mel Gibson's "The Passion of the Christ" has accepted Christ Jesus as the Messiah.




> Messianic Jews, like Christians, believe that Jesus (or as they refer to him, Y'Shua) was the expected Messiah.

Let us pray that the ecumenism toward Jews started by John Paul II and continuing under Benedict XVI will lead more of our elder brothers to realize that our Messiah has come, was killed by and for our sins, is risen, and will come again in glory.
