[Michelle Malkin](https://michellemalkin.com/archives/001492.htm) has a nice roundup of blogs and MSM stories on the UN sex scandal. Thanks much, Michelle, for the plug.




Some stories hit me harder than others, and I've been anti-UN for about 20 years. I thought I'd post a few lines that wrote in my 1993 book, [The Conservative Manifesto:](https://blog.billhennessy.com/forums/1016/PostAttachment.aspx)

There are some things in that little book what I wish, now, I either hadn't written or had written more evenhandedly. My view of the UN, though, has not changed. If anything, it's hardened. In the twelve years since I penned that quote, the United Nations has only given us on the right more reason to sue for its demise.
