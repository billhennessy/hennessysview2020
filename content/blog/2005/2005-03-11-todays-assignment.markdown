I could talk about the wisdom that seeps through your screen as you read. But I'm not going to do that. I'll give you one good reason to go visit._

There's a bit of irony in this. Just Tuesday night, I began writing a blog entry about Donegal Express, which I found quite accidentally a few weeks ago. The writing is crisp and happy, always, almost like an Irish drinking song. 




I missed my window. Any accolades now will smack of reciprocation.




Still, I can honestly say "Thanks" and let you know I am humbled.
