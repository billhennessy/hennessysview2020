Some people hate peace. Tonight, some of them detonated a car bomb in Beirut. Likely, the goal is to divide Christians from Muslims.




For the life of me, I don't get these people. Why is peace so shameful, so dangerous? How defective a mind it must take to equate with "wrong" Lebanese independence wrought by the peaceful withdrawal of Syrian occupation forces.
