Chances are, [the child who lived will have only scant memories of her mother](https://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=1503&u=/afp/20050116/ts_afp/afplifestyleromaniahealthmother_050116165314&printer=1). How much time and energy does a woman nearly 70 have for a baby? I am only 41 with five kids--I don't want more. I see men in their mid-fifties with pre-schoolers and can read the exhaustion, the uncertainty on their faces.




I think it's wonderful that modern science allows people who want children to have them. The drawback to that is people who shouldn't want children--like the elderly--having them.
