Politics used to end at the water's edge.  Now it ends at the treatment room.

Peter Jennings announced today that he has lung cancer--the deadliest cancer of them all.

Many who read this blog detest Jennings's politics, as do I.  But Peter Jennings's life hasn't been all roses.  When Don Imus made fun of his marital situation a few years ago, I couldn't laugh.  Perhaps Imus had never loved.  Or perhaps he'd been spared the pain of a love that blinded him to the treachery of the object of his affection.  It's a hurt that you don't get over.

I wish Mr. Jennings all the best in his fight against death.
