Community Server is supposed to automatically generate trackbacks in the comments of blog entries whenever someone with a common system (mt, .blog, etc.) links. Unfortunately, it doesn't always work. So . . . 




If you link to a blog entry and no trackback generates on Hennessys's view




a) Create a manual trackback in the Comments or




b) E-mail me with the Contact link, and I'll create one for you.




If you e-mail me, please include the blog software you use so I can fix this defect in my software.







Thanks,




Bill
