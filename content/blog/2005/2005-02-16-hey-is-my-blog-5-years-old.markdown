Even though I need to fill in some big gaps in time, my[ posts go back to August 2000](https://blog.billhennessy.com/blogs/hennessys_view/archive/category/1021.aspx). The original site I wrote myself in Active Server Pages (classic) and XML. Later, I upgraded it to ASP.NET. Somewhere in between lie several dozen LONG pieces that I can't find, though I know they exist somewhere in various CD-ROMs burnt from dying hard drives. (I hosted my old site on my home desktop/server via Deerfield's DNS2GO over my cable modem.)




In between, I played around with Linux, but it proved way too time-consuming and limited.




Anyway, I'll leave it up to you: [is Hennessy's View five-years-old? ](https://blog.billhennessy.com/forums/1083/ShowPost.aspx)
