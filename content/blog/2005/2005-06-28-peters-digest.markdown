Today, Pope Benedict XVI released the [Compendium of Catechism of the Catholic Church](https://www.ewtn.com/vnews/getstory_print.asp?number=58110).  The book is a condensed version of the full Catechism released in 1992.  The Holy Father says the book contains all of the essentials, but only the essentials.

If you need a copy now, though, you'll have to get the whole thing here:
