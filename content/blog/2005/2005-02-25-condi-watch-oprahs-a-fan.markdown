So says [Individ](https://individ.blogspot.com/2005/02/hmmmm-condi-stock-just-went-up-for.html). Well, with qualifications. Still, when Oprah speaks, women listen.




On the other hand, [Dean Esmay ](https://www.deanesmay.com/posts/1109283393.shtml)has encouraging poll news for Hillary.




In 1996, I swore that 2000 would be McCain vs. Kerrey (Nebraska), so I won't release my line-up card just yet. But if Condi gives ANY hint that she's not "ruling out" a run in 2008, it will be very difficult for anyone but those two to get media time.
