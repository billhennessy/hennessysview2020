[Michelle Malkin ](https://michellemalkin.com/archives/001572.htm)reports that the United Nations has hired a Kerry hack to run a new blog aimed at salvaging what's left a reputation that currently ranks somewhere between Dan Rather and Ward Churchill.




Hiring Kerry hacks demonstrates the UN's tone-deafness to American politics. I'm still waiting for some ex-official to open the books on the Kofi Annan and his family money laundry.




UPDATE: Remarkably, the UN Blog allows neither comments nor trackbacks. Too bad.
