I don't want to get on a rant against Episcopalians, here, but RomanCatholicBlog and [Ex-Pagan](https://www.expagan.info/blog/?p=123) bring us links to a travesty in an Episcopal church that I must point out.

I know some took offence at [my original swipe ](https://www.hennessysview.com/?p=708)at the Anglican church last week.  I even felt a little writer's remorse, thinking, maybe, I'd been over the top.  But God works, sometimes, in obvious ways.  Aside from tacking a list of 95 Antitheses to their own heads and declaring God dead, I cannot think of surer way than [The Clown Eurcharist](https://romancatholicblog.typepad.com/roman_catholic_blog/2005/05/and_over_at_the.html) to demonstrate to the world that one considers his own religion a joke.

If it makes the Anglicans feel any better, we do, too.  And unless Trinity's bishop metes out draconian punishment for the priests involved in this apostacy, it will be impossible for serious-minded people to mentally divorce the Anglican church and its American sister from the clown images.

For the sake of contrasts, consider that the Roman Catholic church has declared this the year of the Eurcharist.  We are pushing [Perpetual Adoration](https://www.therealpresence.org/eucharst/pea/a2.html) in which someone prays before the exposed Body of Christs each hour of the day, every day, forever.

I there are many, many good Episcopalians who are as embarrassed about this is we are mortified.  Please consider doing as the [Pontificator ](https://pontifications.classicalanglican.net/?p=901)and returning to your Holy Mother Church.

UPDATE:  Some commenting on RomanCatholicBlog points out [a similar travesty](https://www.traditioninaction.org/HotTopics/a015htGoldenCalf1.htm) at a California Roman church.  I will try to find out more about this abomination--for instance, whether those responsible were punished.  If not, I will make every effort to see that they are.

[StJosephsmen.com](https://www.stjosephsmen.com/letters/clownmass.htm) has posted names and addresses for complaining to the Vatican.  Please use them.

I can't find an e-mail address for Fr. Brian Joyce, the miscreant who carried out the desecration of the Holy Eucharist, but[ here's the parish's Guest Book.](https://ctkph.org/enhancement/guestbook/entries.xsl)  Please join me in giving the parish and its pastor your opinion of clown masses.
