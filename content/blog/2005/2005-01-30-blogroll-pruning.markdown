I removed a blog from my roll. The blog posts excellent material, but they have some sort of daemon running that constantly reports that their site has been updated when, in fact, it has not. Good marketing to keep your name at the top of the Recently Updated lists, but, in my opinion, poor sportsmanship. ![](https://blog.billhennessy.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=968)
