During the Terri Schiavo debate, I wrote a piece about how [experts are often wrong ](https://www.hennessysview.com/?p=622)when it comes to specific cases.  Today, [Professor Bainbridge](https://www.professorbainbridge.com/2005/07/scientists_not_.html) links to a [CNN ](https://www.cnn.com/2005/HEALTH/07/13/contradictory.studies.ap/)story about just how often health care experts are:  a full 1/3 of the time.

I told you so.
