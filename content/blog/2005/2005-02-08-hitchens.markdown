Some people demand admiration, and Christopher Hitchens ranks near the top of that list. Before I agreed with him about anything, back in the days when he seemed closer to Alexander Cockburn than to, well, to me, I would find myself pausing on some talkshow just because he was talking.




His writing is as enjoyable as his conversation--and it's conversation he has on talk shows, not interviews.




[Michael Totten favors us](https://www.michaeltotten.com/archives/000730.html), today, with a piece about an evening with Hitch at DC bar. I envy Totten. Aside from Winston Churchill and Peter O'Toole, I can't think of an Englishman I'd rather spend an evening with. (And O'Toole was born in Ireland.)
