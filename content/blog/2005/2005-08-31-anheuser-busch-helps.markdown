A-B Increases Water Donations to 825,000 Cans to Aid Hurricane Katrina Victims


Anheuser-Busch Foundation Also Donates $250,000
To the Red Cross Relief Efforts

In response to requests from relief agencies following the tremendous damage caused by Hurricane Katrina, Anheuser-Busch and its wholesalers have now shipped more than 825,000 cans of safe drinking water to victims of Hurricane Katrina.

Separately, the Anheuser-Busch Foundation announced today that it is donating $250,000 to Red Cross relief efforts along the Gulf Coast.

Our sympathy goes out to all victims of Hurricane Katrina, and this donation will help those who have been most affected by the storm, said Patrick Stokes, president and chief executive officer of Anheuser-Busch Companies.

Anheuser-Busch and its wholesalers are always among the first to lend a hand to those in need, helping them get back on their feet.

The Anheuser-Busch Foundation is the philanthropic arm of Anheuser-Busch Companies, Inc., a St. Louis-based corporation with subsidiaries that include the leading U.S. brewer, one of the largest U.S. manufacturers of aluminum beverage containers and one of the largest theme-park operators in the United States.

Anheuser-Busch and its charitable foundation have reached out to groups that need them, contributing to community organizations across the country and touching countless individual lives.

Over the past decade the company and the Anheuser-Busch Foundation have donated more than $330 million to charitable organizations, including those that support education, health care, the arts, cultural enrichment, social services and environmental conservation.
