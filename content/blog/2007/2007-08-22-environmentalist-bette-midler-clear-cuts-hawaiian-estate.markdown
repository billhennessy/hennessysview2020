You can't beat the truth, folks.

Environmentalist Bette Midler (who, I think, is related to Barbara Streisand) faces state charges in Hawaii for illegally killing more than 200 trees on her estate.  


> The staff of the Board of Land and Natural Resources recommended $6,500 in fines for having the trees felled and for building a graded road without permits required for the land zoned for conservation use.


Of course, she had the trees clear-cut in order to improve the environment, or so [her publicist claims](https://apnews.myway.com/article/20070822/D8R5RGBG1.html).


> "The whole idea with cutting the trees down was with the idea of improving the lot with native species" instead of the nonnative, invasive species that had grown there, Graham said. "It's unfortunate that a mistake was made."


The mistake she made--she and thousands like her--was to feign concern for the environment in order to "fit in" with the Hollywood elite.

A botonist working on the program contradicted the publicist's story, according to the AP story:  "Some native trees also were removed from the property, the botanist said."

Midler is to trees what Michael Vick is to dogs.  But just as the NAA(l)CP gave Vick a pass on dog fighting, expect the left to praise Midler's courage and foresight in killing those dangerous trees before they did even more environmental damage.  Like [Reagan ](https://thinkexist.com/quotation/trees_cause_more_pollution_than_automobiles_do/337369.html)said, "trees caused more pollution than automobiles do."
