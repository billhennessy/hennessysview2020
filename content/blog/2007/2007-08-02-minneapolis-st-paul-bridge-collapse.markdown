_UPDATE and Bump:  Predictably, the idiot left has begun blaming George W. Bush and the Iraq War on Terror for the bridge collapse ([Gateway Pundit](https://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2007/08/moonbats-blame-bushs-war-for-mn-bridge.html)).  They know they're full of manure.  Saturday, liberal Bob Beckel on FoxNews admitted that there was no connection, but he went to explain the liberal lies:  "Those of us who are opposed to this war will anything to advance our point."  _




_It's nice to hear a Democrat fess up to lying.   _




I came home feeling feverish and went to bed earlier.  I woke up at 9:30, planning to do some blogging.

But my first glance




around the world began with [Captain's Quarter ](https://www.captainsquartersblog.com/mt/archives/010703.php)where I learned of the bridge collapse and of Ed Morrissey's search for his




dauther-in-law and granddaaughter. They are okay.




[Michelle Malkin ](https://michellemalkin.com/2007/08/01/minneapolis-bridge-collapse/)has continuing coverage.




CNN has continuous live feed. ***UPDATE*** CNN's live feed stopped at 10:40 p.m. CDT.




Nothing else deserves comment. This deserves only my prayers.




Here's [the bridge before the collapse ](https://www.visi.com/~jweeks/bridges/pages/ms16.html)for reference--you'll be seen plenty of the after photos to compare.
