The problem with elevating dim-witted self promoters to some contrived position of power, as the Dems are learning, is that they are never satisfied with the seat you give them.Â  They want the big seat.Â  They want to call the shots.

Cindy Sheehan, the woman who turned her heroic son's death in Iraq into a national campaign of ego, says she'll run against Nancy Polosi unless the House Speaker introduces articles of impeachment against the President within two weeks:

Cindy Sheehan, the soldier's mother who galvanized the anti-war movement, said Sunday that she plans to seek House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's congressional seat unless she introduces articles of impeachment against President Bush in the next two weeks.

[Michelle Malkin](https://michellemalkin.com/2007/07/08/the-impeachment-drive-gains-steam/) reports that Democrats used the weekend to push harder for impeachment.Â  [WhackNation ](https://www.whackynation.com/?p=850)weighs in looking forward to the fight.  


I say good to both. Â 

Cindy Sheehan running against Nancy Pelosi could give the House Speaker some difficulties in 2008, keeping her away from Washington where Democrats do the most damage.

An impeachment battle in Congress can only help the President and the GOP, which is why Nancy and other Dem leaders are running away from the idea with both left feet.Â  But a concerted push by the idiots like Sheehan who actually run the party could force Pelosi's hand.Â
