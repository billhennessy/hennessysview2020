Because she doesn't want a job?

Not according to [this sickening book](https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/iclk?sa=l&ai=B3IHeiXSURsyKAZSK4ALurJmBCf6exyOGrJWDAsCNtwHAmgwQAhgDIJCzgwIoAjgAUI7SiMIEYMneiIqYpIgTmAGZt7URqgEIUG9saXRpY3OyARV3d3cuaGVubmVzc3lzdmlldy5jb226AQoxMjB4MjQwX2FzyAEB2gEdaHR0cDovL3d3dy5oZW5uZXNzeXN2aWV3LmNvbS_gAQKoAwHIAwfoA4wD9QMIAAIA&num=3&adurl=https://littledemocrats.net&client=ca-pub-2596502848580054&nm=12).
