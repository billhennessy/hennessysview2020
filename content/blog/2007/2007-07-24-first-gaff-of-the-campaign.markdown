[If Hugh Hewitt is right](https://hughhewitt.townhall.com/g/216a8640-745f-4180-8662-79a7a05ab587), the distinction goes to Barack Obama for promising to meet the leaders of "Iran, Syria, Cuba, Venezuela and North Korea without precondition."

Huh.

Didn't Jimmy Carter promise something like that in 1976?  Except then it was China, the Soviet Union, East Germany, and the Grand Dutchy of Fenwick.

This gaff (is that how to spell "gaff?") came during the YouTube debate, which I didn't watch.  I actually have avoided everything about it, but I stumbled onto Hugh Hewitt and had to giggle.

[Jeff Jarvis](https://www.buzzmachine.com/2007/07/23/their-debate/) confirms my original instinct to stay far away.

I suppose Obama didn't win.  Who did?
