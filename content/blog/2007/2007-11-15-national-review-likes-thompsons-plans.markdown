[National Review](https://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MGQxMjc5ZWEyMTg1Zjc3MjY0MjY5OGYzYzZjYTkwMzI=) expresses surprise and thanks that one Republican candidate has actually released comprehensive policy plans to deal with today's challenges.  Even more amazing to NR is the content of those plans:  Conservative.

That candidate is Fred Thompson, who leads the GOP in publishing specific ideas.  Perhaps the reason other candidates don't put their ideas onto paper is that they don't have any.  Or they know that conservatives won't like them.
