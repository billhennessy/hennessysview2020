I hyperbolize now and then, but not this time.

Democrats in the House and Senate voted to encourage criminal prosecution of Americans who report suspicious activity ([Gateway Pundit](https://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2007/07/dnc-kill-john-doe-poster-campaign.html)).  Do you know how difficult it is to formulate a more dramatic representation of that fact than the fact itself ([Discerning Texan](https://discerningtexan.blogspot.com/2007/07/new-democrat-war-on-terror-ad-campaign.html))?

I hate Democrats.  Yeah, I know, you're not supposed to "hate" anyone.  But Democrats are anti-American ass hats.  They breed socialism.  They hate good.  They love evil.  My next book will be re-titled "101 ways to kill a Democrat."  I hate them, I hate them, I hate them.  May they die painful deaths and burn in hell for eternity.

Democrats want to put you in jail for turning in Muslim terrorists.

It's against the law to attempt to stop an act of terrorism.

Democrats are terrorists.

It's against the law to try to stop Democrats.

America:  free no more.
