From the al Qaeda Christmas Album comes Islam's favorite carole:

**Oh, Blasphem-Tree!**

(sung to the tune of "Oh, Tannenbaum")

Oh, Blasphem-tree; oh, Blasphem-tree,

You fill my heart with hatred.

Oh, Blasphem-tree; oh, Blasphem-tree,

Your boughs offend Mohammed.

When I see stars and shiney bells

I want to kill the infidels.

Oh, Blasphem-tree; oh, Blasphem-tree,

Your branches anger Allah!

Oh, Blasphem-tree; oh, Blasphem-tree,

From Teheran to Rihyad.
Oh, Blasphem-tree; oh, Blasphem-tree,

We have declared a jihad.

I'll fly my jet, in Allah's name

into the side of Notre Dame.

Oh, Blasphem-tree; oh, Blasphem-tree,

Your branches anger Allah.

*******

I hope I haven't reversed this trend ([Michelle Malkin](https://michellemalkin.com/2007/12/03/worth-a-thousand-words/))
