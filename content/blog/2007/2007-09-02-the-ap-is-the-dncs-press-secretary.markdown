[As I predicted last week](https://hennessysview.com/2007/08/26/democrats-combat-surge-with-propaganda-campaign/), the Democrats have hired the Associated Press to make up stories that discredit the success of the surge.

Last week, as good new about the surge was cresting, the AP treated as fact an opinion piece that the "body count" in Iraq had doubled since the surge began.

Today, AP customers are _leading_ with another AP opinion piece claiming that August was one of the bloodiest months since the Iraq war began.  While I refuse to link to the sons-of-bitches story, here's the lead paragraph:


> Civilian deaths rose in August to their second-highest monthly level this year, according to figures compiled Saturday by The Associated Press. That raises questions about whether U.S. strategy is working days before Congress receives landmark reports that will decide the course of the war.


Fuck you, AP. 

How brazen of these spineless, lying bastards to publish this trash when all evidence, all observation, all reality points to precisely its opposite.  How filthy and partisan of the Associated Press to side so publicly with the Democrats and with al Qaeda in Iraq?

As un-Christian as it is, at this moment, I would love to read a story of a plane crash taking out a couple of dozen AP reporters.  They are scum.  And may Robert H Reid, the traitor who penned this yellow story, guide their path to hell.

I only hope the American peopel--those who are not already in bed with Islamofascism--can see through the DNC-AP attack on reason.

I invite anyone who has any embarrassing information on an AP employee to publish that information here.   To jog your memory, here is a list of AP Board of Directors.  If you know of anything that would embarrass, discredit, or subject these people to criminal investigation, please let the world know.  Please honor our standards of accuracy by submitting only truthful information about these swine.
