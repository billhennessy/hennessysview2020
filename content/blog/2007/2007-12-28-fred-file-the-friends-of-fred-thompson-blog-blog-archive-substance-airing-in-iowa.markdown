The blog burst has put Fred back on the air in Iowa. From our friend, Sean Hackbarth, at Fred '08:


> 
Your efforts are working. “Substance” is now airing in Iowa. We’re only $87,398 away from making sure it stays running through the caucuses. If 2200 people give $40 we make our goal. That’s doable since our average contribution today has been over $70.This wide-open Republican race means anything can happen. “Substance” on the air could be key to success.Spread the word by blogging, leaving blog comments, talking it up on forums, using your social networks like Facebook, and sending e-mails and e-cards.Let’s reach our goal for Fred.

We have only six hours to raise the final $90K or so, and there's no reason to make this squeaker. You can donate by [clicking HERE](https://www.fred08.com/contribute.aspx?RefererID=4987be96-4295-4dda-be05-236f28ab766f).
