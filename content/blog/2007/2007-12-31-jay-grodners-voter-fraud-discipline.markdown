**UPDATED**

Here's the ISC document in PDF:[Illinois Supreme Court Document](https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/rules-and-decisions.pdf)

According to the Illinois Supreme Court web site[, Jay R. Grodner](https://hennessysview.com/2007/12/31/jay-grodner-chicago-lawyer-and-anti-american/), the scumbag who keyed a deploying Marine's car, committed vote fraud resulting in the suspension of his law license in 1984:

Here's highlights from the Supreme Court's findings:


> The Administrator charged Petersen with forging voter signatures and with actively recruiting Grodner, Presbrey, Weir, and Truemper to assist in this effort. The latter four respondents were so charged. Throughout the briefs and the record the respondents have referred to their acts of forgery as "roundtabling." They explain that this term connotes a group of people gathered at a table who circulate petitions to one another. Each person signs a name obtained from a phone book or voter registration list and then passes the petition on to the person sitting next to him, who does the same.

The hearing panel found that all respondents knowingly engaged in fraudulent activities contrary to justice, honesty and good morals and that the legal profession [99 ILL2D 246] was disparaged as a result . . .  The Review Board concluded that the respondents' forgeries on the petitions **undermined our democratic system of government** and that their **fraudulent activity** brought the legal profession into disrepute. That board recommended . . . six-month suspensions for respondents. . . .


Perhaps Grodner's latest work will cost him his license for good.  [This web site seeks ](https://creditsuit.org/credit.php/blog/comments/check_for_complaints_about_lawyers_before_you_hire_one/)victims of Grodner's abuses as a lawyer (former clients).
