NASA was _wrong_!

[Michelle Malkin does an outstanding job ](https://michellemalkin.com/2007/08/09/hot-news-nasa-fixes-flawed-temperature-data-1998-was-not-the-warmest-year-in-the-millenium/)of breaking down the NASA Y2K error that sort of invented global warming.

In short, 1998 was NOT the hottest year of the 20th century.  And half of the hottest years on record occured before WWII.  Al Gore is an idiot, and now NASA scientists have proven it.

Earlier this week, the wackos got bad news from U of C San Diego and NASA who discovered that [aerosols do not mask atmospheric warming but accelerate it](https://hennessysview.com/?p=8113).  Now, we learn this from NASA:


> Four of the top ten are in the 1930’s, _before mainstream scientists believe humans had any discernible impact on temperatures_.


So, if you believe human activity is responsible for global warming YOU'RE WRONG!

If you believe 8 of the hottest 10 years on record happened in the past 14 years, as Al Gore claims, YOU'RE WRONG!

If you believe that you lived through the hottest year on record, YOU'RE WRONG!

Good Lord, it feels good to tell enviro-wackos they're wrong.

But, there's more . . .


> Several years (2000, 2002, 2003, 2004) fell well down the leaderboard, behind even 1900. (World rankings of temperature are calculated separately.)


In fact, the only thing that Al Gore is right about is churning out more carbon than the average family of 60.

I'm setting the AC down to 68 degrees tonight.  Pleasant dreams.

UPDATE:  I found the global warming alarmist epicenter.  [Proceed with caution](https://learningfundamentals.com.au/global-warming/).

UPDATE:  [AP story](https://apnews.myway.com/article/20070810/D8QTT7IO0.html) on several endangered species making comeback, plus deforestation slowing in Peru.  Must be global warming.
