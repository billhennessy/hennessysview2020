Someone calling himself [Mullah Cirac posted a comment](https://hennessysview.com/?p=8116#comment-372) to an earlier post on the growing popularity of the war in Iraq.  I posted a long reply to the Mullah.  Then I checked my comments meta to see if he left legit e-mail and website.  I don't know about the e-mail, but web url he claims as his belongs to a girl from Texas who might be able to kick Cirac's unholy ass from Mecca to Odessa.

[AniMEL](https://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=21012024&blogID=296590446) writes about "Nazi America."  When I saw the title and started reading, I expected that the mullah had led me to a post that would "prove" America is the great Satan for killing and incarcerating fine young terrorists.  But the post goes in a different direction, and it goes there under the pen of a talented story teller.  If you read nothing else today, [read AniMEL's Nazi America](https://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=21012024&blogID=296590446).  She's obviously the kind of [American woman](https://hennessysview.com/?p=8116#comment-488) I wrote about in my reply to Mullah Cirac.

***UPDATE***
DOH!  I was looking at the wrong comment.  Mel, of aniMEL fame, responded reasonably to one of my unreasonable tirades.  I thought the url on her comment was the url on Mullah Cirac's.  Everything else I wrote above, though, landed squarely on the nail's head.
