Maybe.  Maybe not.

But the new al-Qaeda video featuring a haggard  Osama bin Laden has folks speculating about his health and even his life.

[Gateway Pundit ](https://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2007/07/al-qaeda-releases-new-osama-tape.html)compares the most recent video (in which bin Laden appears for less than a minute) with a video from 2002.  The background and bin Laden's attire are identical.  And doesn't look so hot.

If this is not a new taping, then it could be an attempt by al-Qaeda to hide the terrorist's death.  If bin Laden is dead and this video is a forgery, then Michael Moore better get his fat ass to Pakistan to expose this conspiracy.

Over at [Freedom Eden,](https://freedomeden.blogspot.com/2007/07/bin-ladens-backdont-look.html) Mary has another take on the new tape that is worth a read.
