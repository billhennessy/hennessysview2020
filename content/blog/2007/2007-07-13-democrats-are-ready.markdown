The Democrat Party released its official [agendum for the 2008 party convention today](https://www.gopbloggers.org/mt/archives/004985.php). Mark Noonan, journalist extraordinaire, obtained an advance copy.

From the opening flag-burning to the end-of-evening driving arrangements, the party of defeat has thought of everything.

Mark has formatted the schedule for convenient printing and laminating.  Be sure to share it with your friends.

Don't miss the first comment from a whinny liberal idiot, either.
