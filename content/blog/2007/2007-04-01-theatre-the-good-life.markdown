The play is Noel Coward's _Long Island Sound_, a recently discovered Coward play first produced in 2002--more than 50 years after Sir Noel wrote the piece.  For you edification, I link to a [New York Times review](https://theater2.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?res=9503E5DD1239F936A25756C0A9649C8B63&n=Top%2FReference%2FTimes%20Topics%2FPeople%2FC%2FCoward%2C%20Noel) of the original TACT performance.
