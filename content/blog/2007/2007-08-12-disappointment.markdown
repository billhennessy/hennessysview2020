The weather’s always good, for one;
too hot, too cold, it rained, it snowed.
Work will work—oh work is fine;
busy, slow, mean boss, long lunch.
Fatigue can be my friend at times
when my eyes just won’t stay open
and energy that never ends
comes in handy now and then.
Kids are always under foot, it seems,
wanting this and breaking that.
My hair’s a mess or just got fixed
or won’t stay put or needs a bath.
Could my mood be any more in play?
It’s the same and always changing.
Did I mention that I’m out of gas?
Have to leave a little early.
When it’s time to lay me down,
down is how I’m meant to lay,
you don’t get caught up in excuses:
you’ll get yours, you will, some day.
