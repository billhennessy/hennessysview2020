For the past 4 years, Russian dictator Putin has moved his country closer and closer to its pre-Yeltsin isolation.  Today, he announced [suspension of NATO inspections](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/14/AR2007071400641.html) of nuclear missile sites.



> Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree freezing participation in the treaty that cited "extraordinary circumstances ... that affect the security of the Russian Federation and require immediate measures," the Kremlin said in a statement.



Meanwhile, Russia continues a military build-up which most Americans have ignored.

Some will accuse me of longing for the good old days of the Cold War, but they're missing a dangerous story if they do.

I don't trust Putin, and I don't think I'm alone.  Over at [Depleted Uranium](https://depleteduranium.wordpress.com/2007/07/14/germans-should-be-nervous/), a writer points out that Russia is amassing tank divisions near the Polish border.  A weak Poland is all that stands between Russia and Germany.

Perhaps the 2008 candidates should spend a little time thinking about these ominous signs from the Bear of the East, and perhaps we should all appreciate Condi Rice's expertise a bit more.  (Secretary Rice is a Russian expert.)
