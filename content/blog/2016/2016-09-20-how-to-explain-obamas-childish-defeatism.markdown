Barack Obama has thrown in the towel on Hillary Clinton's failed campaign. Before you see how that is, let's look at a study on a key factor of business success or failure.



### CEO Locus of Control



In a series of studies, researchers found that companies whose CEO displayed an external locus of control were 650 percent more likely to fail than similar companies whose CEO showed an internal locus of control ([source](https://homepages.se.edu/cvonbergen/files/2013/01/CEO-Locus-of-Control-and-Small-Firm-Performance.pdf)).

Locus of control refers to a person's tendency to see external or internal factors as primarily responsible for outcomes. People who believe the man makes history have an internal locus, while people who believe history makes the man have an external locus. Studies of individuals have shown that people with internal locus tend to be happier and more successful than people with external locus.

The reason why an internal locus of control helps should be obvious. If I believe I control my life, I can overcome obstacles. I will be more tenacious. I will find a way. But if someone has an external locus, he will blame factors outside his control and give up.



### Barack Obama Has Given Up



In a speech over the weekend, Obama blamed Fox News and Rush Limbaugh for Donald Trump's amazing rise in the polls.



> If all you’re doing is watching Fox News and listening to Rush Limbaugh and reading some of the blogs that are churning out a lot of misinformation on a regular basis, then it’s very hard for you to think that you’re going to vote for somebody who you’ve been told is taking the country in the wrong direction.



Riiiiight. It's your fault for listening to people who disagree with Obama. (Have you noticed that the community Obama famously "organized" is shooting itself to death? See [HeyJackass.com](https://heyjackass.com))

Obama's argument is a lot like Romney's 47 percent argument. It absolves Obama of any responsibility for a) America's decline or b) Hillary's hideous loss on November 8.

What's most telling, though, is that Obama's admitting defeat in advance. He's literally saying there's nothing he or Hillary or faithful Democrats can do short of mass murder or election fraud. Forces beyond the President's control will determine the outcome, so campaigning is pointless.

For the sake of my own sanity, I'll agree to agree with Obama and urge him to sit down and shut up until he hands the keys to Air Force One to Donald J. Trump on January 20.
