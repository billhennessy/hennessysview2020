The book is 180 pages and covers three big periods of thinking about Trump:




** The Clown
** The Party Crasher
** The Champion


The book ends with a prediction for how the election will end, which you need to read. You can make fun of me if I turn out to be wrong.

Buy the book in [paperback](https://www.createspace.com/6282532) or Kindle.
