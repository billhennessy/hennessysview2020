Today, Rep. Ann Wagner (R-MO) abandoned her party's nominee to support a rape accomplice for President. **Ann Wagner has lost her moral authority **on** all matters outside of her own home**. I call on Mrs. Wagner to resign from the House of Representatives and to retire gracefully from public life.

Mrs. Wagner seems to believe that being a woman gives her some unique moral vantage point. She forgets that she's not the only woman in America.

**[click here to read my take on Trump's Access Hollywood remarks](https://hennessysview.com/2016/10/08/clinton-vs-trump-on-women/).**

The women who really have a unique moral vantage point on Trump and the Clintons are the many, many women Bill Clinton has raped, molested, and abused. **These women were also abused, threatened, belittled, intimidated, and bullied by Mrs. Clinton.**

Here's what a few of these women have to say:



> 

> 
> Hillary calls Trump's remarks "horrific" while she lives with and protects a "Rapist". Her actions are horrific.

Those are some thoughts from Bill and Hillary Clinton's sexual abuse victims. Compared to their voices, Ann Wagner spews meaningless, selfish babble.

Finally, I see that Senator Roy Blunt is sticking with Trump. Good for Roy. I am glad I endorsed him.
