I was a guest of Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM channel 125 yesterday. [Dan Riehl wrote this very nice story about my appearance](https://www.breitbart.com/radio/2016/08/03/tea-party-leader-hennessy-you-cant-be-never-trump-and-never-hillary/) on Breitbart News:

> ## Tea Party activist Bill Hennessy chronicled his transition from Donald Trump opposition to Trump supporter in the book _[Turning on Trump](https://www.amazon.com/Turning-Trump-Evolution-William-Hennessy/dp/1533313598)_ and shared some of his insights with_Breitbart News Daily_ SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon Wednesday.

“I started off very anti-Trump,” said Hennessy, “and over the course of the primary season, I did a complete one-eighty.”

Hennessy called the so-called Never Trump movement “silly,” adding, “You can’t really be Never Trump and Never Hillary. One of the two will be the next President of the United States.” Hennessy sees Trump as the more anti-establishment and conservative choice.

Concluded Hennessy, “If you’re trying to play this cutesy game–I’m being true to some principles that allows me to do things that throw the election to Hillary Clinton–you’re going to bear responsibility for what she does.”

_Breitbart News Daily_ airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.



Thanks, Dan.
