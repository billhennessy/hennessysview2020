Yesterday I speculated that [Barack Obama had grown sick of Hillary's corruption](https://hennessysview.com/2016/10/31/seems-like-obama-is-tired-of-hillarys-s/), lies, and criminal disregard for the rule of law.

A lot of people thought I was nuts, that I was reading too much into the White House statement that discredited Hillary's primary talking point about James Comey.

But today the [Gateway Pundit reports that **Michelle Obama has scrubbed all references**](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/11/rats-jump-ship-michelle-obama-scrubs-hillary-clinton-twitter-history/)** to Hillary Clinton from both of her Twitter timelines**. This seems to confirm my speculation that the Obamas are washing his hands of Crooked Hillary.

When you think about it, it's easy to see that **Hillary hurt Obama's legacy**. Her tenure as Secretary of State was a disaster. Wikileaks confirms what Obama might have suspected all along—that Hillary used her office as Secretary of State to shake down foreign and domestic actors for her private gain.

Expect Obama to throw Hillary under the bus before Tuesday.

UPDATE: Senator Elizabeth Warren has scrubbed Hillary from her @SenWarren timeline, too. It's down to one tweet from January, 2012. ([Here's the search](https://twitter.com/search?q=Hillary%20OR%20Clinton%20from%3ASenWarren&src=typd)) Warren's old [@elizabethforma](https://twitter.com/elizabethforma) timeline was also scrubbed back to 2012. Clearly, these Democrat women know something CNN doesn't.
