**Beyond Top Secret.**

Hillary famously kept an email server in her private bedroom where it was safe from being used as Bill's YouPorn hub. (I'm pretty sure Bill Clinton hasn't visited the inside of his wife's sleeping chamber in the 21st century.)

Being plugged into the internet, though, and lacking even the most rudimentary security, Hillary's server was exposed to the prying eyes of Chinese, North Korean, Russian, and Anonymous spies.

**Today the United States Inspector General revealed that some of the documents on that insecure server contained the highest secrets of national security-**-Top Secret/Special Access Program. The TS/SAP information joins its Top Secret, Secret, and Confidential cousins which previously disclosed.

Apparently the only thing Hillary didn't have on her server was the whereabouts of Jimmy Hoffa's body--and husband Bill's.

And who's reporting this? Not just Fox News. Not just National Review. But that bastion of right-wing demagoguery and partisanship [NBC News admits Hillary is in deep doo-doo](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/hillary-clinton-emails-contained-info-above-top-secret-ig-n499886).

As I tweeted earlier, this bombshell means **only corruption at the Department of Justice or a presidential pardon can keep Hillary out of jail awaiting trial.** (To which one brilliant person responded, "I'll take corrupt DOJ for $500.")

So what does Petraeus have to do with this? I'll tell you.

[General David Petraeus, architect of the Iraqi Surge, pled guilty to allowing his mistress to see classified material.](https://hennessysview.com/2012/11/13/what-if-petraeus-knew-exactly-what-he-was-doing/) That was four years ago. He took his punishment and moved on.

Today we learned that [Secretary of Defense Ash Carter is considering retroactively demoting Petraeus](https://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/01/18/exclusive-pentagon-may-demote-david-petraeus.html). The demotion would be belated slap in the face to a remarkable military leader, and the Army's top prosecutors opposed the move in 2012 and again today.

So why is Carter considering a new round of punishments for Petraeus?

**Perhaps to insulate the White House should the Department of Justice indict Clinton. **

Think about it. When the Hillary email story broke, the lazy press immediately dredged up comparisons to the Petraeus case. (In fairness, the similarities were strong. General Petraeus had an affair with his biographer, and Hillary is married to Bill Clinton.)

Seriously, though, **an indictment of Hillary would unleash the entire Clinton Mafia** against the DoJ and the White House.

What better defense than to say, "look how seriously we take breeches of security protocols. We demoted a legendary Army general for allowing just one trusted person access to notebooks that could not easily be copied or further disseminated. We have no idea how many copies now exist of Hillary Clinton's TS/SAP emails which she illegally stored on a prohibited server."

I'm not saying Clinton will be indicted. But I do suspect Petraeus is the victim of White House ass-covering in case she is.

We can only hope.
