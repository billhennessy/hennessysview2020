Have you ever met someone who's just nasty? Mean? Self-centered? Treats "little people" like dirt?

If you answered "yes" to any of these questions, **you've probably met Hillary Clinton.** Hillary is likely a psychopath according to official FBI documents released Friday.

What is psychopathy? For the answer, let's go to the book [Almost a Psychopath](https://geni.us/almost) (h/t [Eric Barker](https://www.bakadesuyo.com/2016/10/how-to-deal-with-psychopaths/)):



> Psychopathy is a psychological condition in which the individual shows a profound lack of empathy for the feelings of others, a willingness to engage in immoral and antisocial behavior for short-term gains, and extreme egocentricity.



You'll recognize all of these symptoms in the FBI witness accounts of Hillary Clinton in a moment. First, though, [Eric Barker](https://www.bakadesuyo.com/2016/10/how-to-deal-with-psychopaths/) does a great job of teaching you how to spot a psychopath.



> **And you know that old saying about not trusting people who are nice to you but mean to waiters at a restaurant? Turns out it’s true.** Psychopaths and narcissists are extremely status conscious with a strong tendency to “kiss up and kick down.”

From [Without Conscience](https://geni.us/without):

_Referring to psychologist Harry Levinson’s work on healthy and unhealthy narcissism in managers, Hogan noted that unhealthy narcissists have an almost grandiose sense of certainty and a disdain for subordinates. “They are particularly good at ingratiating themselves with their seniors **but brutalize their juniors,**” he is quoted as saying._

Now, let's see what the FBI witnesses say of life with Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State. According to sworn statements by Hillary's former security agents, Hillary Clinton regularly:




** Verbally abused and intimidated her juniors
** Disrespected ambassadors
** Recklessly endangered lives of subordinates by ordering them to break security protocol in hostile situations for her own convenience
** Flouted State Department and military security rules and procedures
** Stole government property for her personal gain
** Generally treated everybody like shit


Here are some highlights, via[ Zero Hedge](https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-17/security-agent-tells-fbi-what-it-was-really-work-hillary-clinton). Remember, this is from an official FBI witness statement released on Friday against the FBI's wishes. You can [read the whole thing here](https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-17/security-agent-tells-fbi-what-it-was-really-work-hillary-clinton):

Horrible treatment of subordinates:



> [Redacted] explained that **CLINTON's treatment of DS agents on her protective detail was so contemptuous that many of them sought reassignment or employment elsewhere. Prior to CLINTON's tenure, being an agent on the Secretary of State's protective detail was seen as an honor and privilege reserved for senior agents. **However, by the end of CLINTON's tenure, it was staffed largely with new agents **because it was difficult to find senior agents willing to work for her**. [_Redacted_] **claimed to have had at least one conversation with Secret Service agents who experienced the same poor treatment.**



Stealing from government offices:



> Early in CLINTON's tenure as Secretary of State, **she and her staff were observed removing lamps and furniture from the State Department which were transported to her residence in Washington, D.C.**



Violating security protocols and mistreatment of ambassadors:



> [Redacted] I served briefly on former Secretary CLINTON's protective detail in 2009. **From her own experience, and information obtained through [_Redacted_] and other agents, [_Redacted_] described a "stark difference" between RICE and CLINTON with regard to obedience to security and diplomatic protocols. **RICE observed strict adherence to State Department security and diplomatic protocols while **CLINTON frequently and "blatantly" disregarded them.** For example, it is standard security and diplomatic protocol for the Secretary of State to ride in the armored limousine with the local U.S. ambassador when traveling in countries abroad. It is seen as diplomatic protocol for the Secretary of State to arrive at foreign diplomatic functions with the local ambassador; however, CLINTON refused to do so, instead choosing to be accompanied in the limousine by her Chief of Staff, HUMA ABEDIN. **This frequently resulted in complaints by ambassadors who were insulted and embarrassed by this breach of protocol. ** [Redacted] explained that **CLINTON's protocol breaches were well known throughout Diplomatic Security and were "abundant."**



Putting innocent subordinates in harm's way:



> On a trip to Jakarta, Indonesia, in early 2009, CLINTON requested to visit an area of Jakarta that presented security and safety challenges. This visit was reportedly for a photo opportunity regarding CLINTON's "clean cooking stoves" initiative. The DS advance team recommended against traveling to this area because the route could not be secured and was lined with dangerous circumstances and individuals. As such, the DS advance team recommended in writing that this excursion be stricken from the schedule but were told by DS management that it was going to happen because "she wanted it." **DS agents felt this excursion into potentially hostile areas placed CLINTON, her staff, the media, and her security detail in unnecessary danger in order to conduct a photo opportunity for "her election campaign." **



Colluding with a fawning press to cover up her misdeeds:



> DS agents had the perception that CLINTON was using her position as Secretary of State to campaign for President of the United States. **DS agents felt CLINTON traveled with hand-picked media who would present her in favorable light in order to garner political support**. It was also believed that **CLINTON disregarded security and diplomatic protocols, occasionally without regard for the safety of her staff and protection detail, in order to gain favorable press.**



Endangering the lives of subordinates again:



> CLINTON traveled in an armored vehicle whose passenger windows do not open. This is a design feature for the protectiOn of the occupants. However, the driver's window does open slightly. On one occasion while travelin  to Palestine CLINTON ordered the limousine driver, believed to be [_Redacted_] to open the window while in "occupied territory", referring to a dangerous area of the West Bank. [Redacted] initially declined to respond to CLINTON's request; however, **repeated demands by CLINTON forced him to open his window despite the danger to himself and the occupants**.



Refusing to follow the law on information security:



> **By DS security policy, no cell phones are allowed inside the SCIF and DS agents, officers, and staff are required to leave their cell phones outside the door in secure lockers. CLINTON refused to abide to this security requirement and brought her cell phone, believed to be a Blackberry, inside the SCIF where a DS agent assigned to Post 1 was required to guard it. DS agents were indignant that they were required to follow security policy but CLINTON made herself exempt from the same regulations.**



Let's look at that psychopathy checklist, shall we?




** profound lack of empathy for the feelings of others. CHECK
** a willingness to engage in immoral and antisocial behavior for short-term gains. CHECK
** extreme egocentricity. CHECK


You might be tempted to apply this checklist to Trump (or anybody else who's ever run for public office). But Trump fails that first criterion. How many times have you heard Trump apologize for his transgressions? He just apologized, numerous times, for the Billy Bush remarks (which weren't what you heard they were). He said he probably didn't deserve support from evangelical Christians. He's helped numerous people who could do nothing for him.

You've never heard Hillary Clinton apologize for belittling and endangering the lives of her subordinates. And you've never heard that Trump put people's lives in danger for his own thrills.

Hillary Clinton acts like a psychopath. Even if she didn't kill Seth Rich, [Ron Brown](https://hennessysview.com/2016/10/02/killing-ron-brown/), [Antonin Scalia](https://hennessysview.com/2016/10/13/killing-scalia-the-clinton-crime-family/), and [dozens of other people who mysteriously died after learning bad stuff about the Clintons, ](https://www.whatreallyhappened.com/WRHARTICLES/THE%20CLINTON%20BODY%20COUNT.pdf)Hillary treats subordinates like dirt. She is a far worse human than[ Trump has ever been accused of being](https://blog.dilbert.com/post/151933602961/lie-detection-and-scandals). And the FBI confirms this.

Confused by the choice for President? [This test will help you](https://hennessysview.com/2016/10/17/braggart-or-psychopath-the-ultimate-test/).

P.S. The FBI redacted the witness's name. Maybe they wanted to protect her from the Clinton Crime Family. Don't be surprised if [Redacted] gets "suicided" shortly. They all do.
