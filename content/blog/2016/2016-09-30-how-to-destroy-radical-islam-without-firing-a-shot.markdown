You probably know that I admire Scott Adams quite a bit. He's brilliantly predicted everything Trump has done. And he's not finished dazzling us with his prediction skills.

Yesterday [he made a prediction of how we'll kill ISIS](https://blog.dilbert.com/post/151056198611/the-wall-around-isis). It isn't pretty. He's not advocating what will happen. He's just telling us what will happen.

I'm going to offer an alternative end to ISIS. It's one I've advocated for attacking radical Islam since 2001. And it's far less brutal. It's perfect for a Master Persuader President like Trump.

Try to remember the feelings in the fall of 2001.  It's easy. The month after 9/11 was a time of high anxiety. Amid the angst, my ex-wife asked me what I would do about radical Islam.

My answer: undermine their youth.

I went into a little detail.

I said, “corrupt their youth. Replace their religion with sex, drugs, and rock-n-roll. Destroy the dignity and authority of parents, especially fathers. Give them distractions--cell phones, computers loaded with video games. And wait 10 years."

Today, I'd substitute smart phones for computers. (The iPhone was still six years away then.)

She responded later, saying, "but that's what you've always said was ruing _this_ country."

"Exactly," I said.

I like my plan better than Scott's. Not only does mine avoid the problems of a messy genocide (followed by a lot of finger-pointing), my plan opens up new markets for American goods and services. All those Carrier air conditioners that Trump will keep coming out of Indiana need to go somewhere. What's a better market for AC units than a desert?

If George Bush had implemented in my plan in 2001, the terror threat would be over and GDP growth would be 5 percent.
