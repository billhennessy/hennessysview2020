Wow! Larry Kudlow really like [Turning On Trump](https://amzn.to/29DcFWp). You can [listen to my interview with Larry here](https://www.wabcradio.com/2012/12/09/kudlowpodcasts/). My hit starts at 1:36:48, but the whole show is great.

On Wednesday, [Mark Reardon](https://stlouis.cbslocal.com/show/mark-reardon/) and I had a great Trump conversation on[ KMOX Radio](https://stlouis.cbslocal.com/show/mark-reardon/). You can listen to that here. You should probably follow Mark on twitter: https://twitter.com/MarkReardonKMOX

And if you missed it, Jamie Allman was so gracious and kind to have me on[ The Allman Report on Friday. Here's that video.](https://hennessysview.com/2016/07/09/trump-talking-on-the-allman-report/)

If you're wondering why I'm getting media attention, you'll find the [answer in my new book](https://amzn.to/29DcFWp).
