Contrasts.

Two Politico stories, just weeks apart, demonstrate the remarkable contrasts between the two candidates for president.

The headline of the [Trump story](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/donald-trump-fec-fundraising-225648) tells it all:



> Trump raised $32 million with RNC, **but kept only a fraction**.



And the [Hillary story](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/dnc-leak-clinton-team-deflected-state-cash-concerns-226191):



> Leaked emails show officials tried to obscure the fact that **Clinton allowed states to keep only a tiny fraction of proceeds** from joint fundraising.



Trump is on Team America. Hillary is on Team Hillary.
