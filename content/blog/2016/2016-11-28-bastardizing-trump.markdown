Jill Stein has raised nearly $7 million in an effort to overturn election results in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. She has no chance of winning any of those states, and Hillary Clinton has joined Team Stein.

So what's the point?

Apparently,[ Stein and Clinton want the recounts to miss their December 19 deadline](https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-11-27/democrats-real-strategy-launching-recounts). December 19 is the Constitutionally mandated Electoral College vote. If the recounts are incomplete on the 19th, voters in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania will be disenfranchised, no candidate will have 270 electoral votes, and the election will be thrown to the US House of Representatives. Once the 19th passes, the recounts will stop in all states. Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania will go down as a draw. As if no one voted in those states.

> As Edward Foley, an expert in election law at Moritz College of Law at Ohio State University, pointed out to the [Milwaukee Journal Sentinel](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/11/25/recount-would-have-move-quickly/94417686/), **electors from around the country have to meet by December 19th to cast their electoral college votes.  To the extent recounts in WI, MI and PA have not been completed by that time,** which experts assign a high probability that they will not,** there is a chance that the electoral votes from those three states wouldn't be counted leaving neither candidate with the required electoral votes to win the presidency **(electoral count would be Trump 260 versus Hillary 232).



Because Republicans control the House, there's a better than 99% chance they would elect Trump. So why all the recount effort?

Because: **optics**.

The left wants to de-legitimize Trump. They hope to combine the popular vote with the fact that a Republican House elected Trump to make the whole thing look like a scam. The same way [Thomas Jefferson and John Quincy Adams became President](https://usgovinfo.about.com/od/thepoliticalsystem/a/electiontie.htm). But the Soros-controlled media (Washington Post, New York Times, CNN, MSNBC, CBS, ABC, NBC, etc) will beat Americans over the head with illegitimacy. They want to make Trump's presidency a bastard.

If the people of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania want their votes to count, they better make sure the recounts complete by December 19.
