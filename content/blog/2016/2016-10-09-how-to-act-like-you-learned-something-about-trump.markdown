People in the media and the GOP are acting like they learned something on Friday. That's when the Washington Post released [an audio (later conjoined with video) of Donald Trump talking ](https://hennessysview.com/2016/10/08/clinton-vs-trump-on-women/)lewd about his exploits with women.

I say media people and [Republicans are  "acting" like they learned something](https://hennessysview.com/2016/10/08/lets-hear-from-the-clintons-victims/), because they didn't. We didn't. **Everybody who's paid attention to the race (or pop culture) already knew how Trump is**. Everybody knows Trump brags about his sexual prowess and how women melt around him. There's nothing new, but a few very emotional people who have trouble separating their feelings from their thoughts give into the impulse to _act_ like they've learned something. No one's that ignorant.

But something bigger remains the same. **[Antonin Scalia is still dead](https://hennessysview.com/2016/09/25/if-you-want-mike-lee-on-the-supreme-court-you-have-to-vote-for-roy-blunt/).** The first significant act of the new Congress and the new administration will be to fill that empty seat on the Supreme Court.

**Scalia's seat will be filled by someone like Elena Kagan or someone like Mike Lee.** The person who appoints that replacement will be someone who covers up her own crimes and her husband's rapes, or someone who brags about women desiring him because he's a wealthy star.

Again, nothing's changed.

**If you want a Supreme Court that rules like Elena Kagan, vote for Clinton. If you want a Supreme Court that thinks like Mike Lee, vote for Trump.**

You've learned nothing, so don't act like you have.
