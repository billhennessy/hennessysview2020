You know how this game goes. You make a wish, I'll do my damnedest to grant it. Because I am just that <del>kink</del>  kind of guy.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg, aka Notorious RBG, made a wish last week. Being a lawyer, her wish came with a contingency.

I just launched a [GoFund.](https://www.gofundme.com/notoriousrbg)Me[ project to grant her that wish](https://www.gofundme.com/notoriousrbg). And why not?

Ruth Bader Ginsburg is a true Horatio Alger story. Born to Russian-Jewish immigrant parents, raised in the Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn, RBG rose the highest legal position in the United States: Supreme Court Justice.

Wow.

She wasn't quite the first woman. Republican Sandra Day O'Connor beat her. But she was a woman. And a very, very liberal woman at that.

Now, she's asked for America's help. [**She wants to retire to New Zealand**](https://www.gofundme.com/notoriousrbg). Hell, who doesn't. But on a government pension and in advanced years, golden years in the land near Oz is a bit of stretch for the daugther of immigrants.

You have a chance to grant this old woman's dream. But there's a catch.

Justice Ginsburg imposed a contingency on her dream retirement: she'll only move to New Zealand if Donald Trump wins.

I can help. As usual.

My GoFund.Me project seeks to aim $25,000 to [move RBG to New Zealand](https://www.gofundme.com/notoriousrbg). Every penny over $25,000 will go help elect Donald Trump.

If we raise $50,000, $25k goes to Ruth Bader Ginsburg's move and $25k goes to Trump.

Please give generously. Our republic could depend on it.
