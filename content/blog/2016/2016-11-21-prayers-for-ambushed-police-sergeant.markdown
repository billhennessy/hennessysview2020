Two cops were ambushed today. One in San Antonio. One in St. Louis. St. Louis Hills. An intersection I know very well from my youth. [The St. Louis police sergeant is expected to survive](https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/st-louis-police-officer-shot-in-the-face/article_e119c0eb-d2a1-5fd0-9600-cc252d77fed1.html). 

It's time to end the war on cops. Please pray for the wounded officer, his family, our community, and all our fine police officers and emergency responders.
