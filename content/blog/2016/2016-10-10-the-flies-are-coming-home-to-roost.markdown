Frank Luntz—no fan of Donald J. Trump—said it best: he came into the second debate believing the race was over, but he came out believing Trump is back in the race.

I realize CNN bought a poll that said Clinton won the debate. But CNN has a history of lying, cheating, and hiding facts. I wouldn't bet a wooden nickel on anything I heard on CNN.

I watched most of the debate at a bar in South St. Louis. The crowd was there to watch football. Mostly non-partisan, apolitical folks. But they quickly became Trump fans.

As you think about it now, you might realize the race is on and Trump is as likely to win as he was before. Trump looked like the President we need and the President we want. He owned the stage while Hillary squirmed under the weight of logic, reason, facts, and a fly.

Yes, a fly.

A filthy, manure-munching fly that wouldn't leave Hillary alone. Like a metaphor from [Westworld](https://hiddenremote.com/2016/10/04/westworld-dolores-and-her-fly/). [Jim Hoft calls is an omen](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/10/fly-lands-hillarys-face-debate/).

Droids eventually fall to flesh and blood humans with souls. For all his flaws, Trump is human. In fact, his flaws make him human.

Delores, the droid on Westworld, reached the point of artificial intelligence that she could swat the fly that dogged her.

Hillary is still 100% artificial.

I'm guessing there's a fly in [Ann Wagner](https://hennessysview.com/2016/10/08/lets-hear-from-the-clintons-victims/)'s face tonight. It's eating the egg.
