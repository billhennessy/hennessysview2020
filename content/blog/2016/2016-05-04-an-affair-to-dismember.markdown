If you've ever cheated on your spouse just to get back at your daughter for dating or marrying the wrong man, you're probably a #nevertrump person like George Will.

Suppose your daughter married a man you didn't approve of. You would probably respond by cheating on your own spouse, would you not? Having an affair would teach your daughter a lesson, right? And if your spouse and your friends and your other children suffered, too bad. Collateral damage is the cost of war.

Because Republican voters nominated a candidate the NeverTrumpers disapprove of, the NeverTrumpers say they'll politically sleep with a woman who intentionally built an email server to hide her Clinton Foundation money laundering operation from law enforcement. For example, NeverTrumper and conservative blogger [George Will plans to have an affair with Hillary Clinton](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/if-trump-is-nominated-the-gop-must-keep-him-out-of-the-white-house/2016/04/29/293f7f94-0d9d-11e6-8ab8-9ad050f76d7d_story.html), the woman who pressured Obama to turn Libya into an ISIS breeding ground. Hillary Clinton, who publicly blamed the Benghazi attack on a video even after her illegal emails revealed she knew damn well it was an act of terrorism. [Then she called the families of Benghazi victims liars](https://thefederalist.com/2016/03/10/watch-hillary-clinton-call-the-mother-of-a-benghazi-victim-a-liar/). Will will sleep with Hillary Clinton who promised to put "a lot of coal miners and a lot of coal companies out of business," then [told an out-of-work coal miner h](https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-05-03/i-dont-know-how-explain-it-confused-clinton-cant-explain-own-comments-coal-miner)e didn't hear what she said.

And George Will wants to sleep with this woman. Politically speaking, of course.

I realize George is an old man. He was old in 2009 when he warned that [blue jeans would lead to the downfall of Western Civilization](https://www.post-gazette.com/opinion/Op-Ed/2009/04/21/George-F-Will-I-hate-jeans/stories/200904210230). Will wrote, "it is a straight line from the fall of the Bastille to the rise of denim." In the same post, Mr. Will prescribed a model of male dress that, in his view, should guide every man from here to eternity: "If Fred Astaire would not have worn it, don't wear it." (The 90 percent of you who have no idea who Fred Astaire was can look him up on Wikipedia. I guess.) That "jeans is devil-wear" column was the moment [level-headed people stopped taking Will seriously](https://hotair.com/archives/2009/04/16/george-will-stop-wearing-blue-jeans-you-juvenile-rabble/).

On Monday, lead nevertrumper Bill Kristol said he'll "never say never" about voting for Trump after having said "never Trump" about two million times. Kristol's wisdom to walk back his never Trump statements will shine through as Donald Trump goes to work on Hillary Clinton. Benghazi and the emails will, finally, became household scandals. People old enough to remember the 1990s will sober up and realize the horrific danger to America Hillary presents.

Those Republicans who insist on sleeping with Hillary? Wear a condom. You don't want to get any on you.

I'm for America. I'm[ for Trump](https://hennessysview.com/2016/05/03/for-trump/).
