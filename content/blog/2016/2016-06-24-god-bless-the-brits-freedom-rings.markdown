As an American, I am proud of the people from whose loins our nation sprang. United Kingdom has voted to leave the European Union. The Brits rejected globalist, elitist threats and insults to vote for independence. Like America did in 1776.

Savor this moment in history. You were alive to see a nation reject foreign tyranny. Â Every Brit who voted LEAVE showed courage and love of freedom. God bless them all. The last time I felt like this was when the Berlin Wall came down.

I loved England. (And, as a son of Ireland, that's one hell of an admission)

Next up: [America for Trump](https://hennessysview.com/2016/06/01/what-the-world-needs-now-a-trump-book/)!

UPDATE: BBC and SkyNews call it for LEAVE.

Economist Steven Moore says Western world rejecting elitism, open borders. But markets are over-reacting like idiots. Big buying opportunities. [Gateway Pundits find trillions in opportunity](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/06/bloomberg-analysts-half-trillion-erased-global-markets-following-brexit-vote/).

The US media will try to spin this, but don't be fooled. This was a rejection of open borders. As Trump says, "Either you have a country, or you don't." British voters decided to have a country. They told the globalists in the EU to get screwed. Good for Brittain.

CNN can't hide the truth:

David Cameron expected to resign Friday.

No coincidence that the issues in #brexit campaign perfectly paralleled the issues Donald Trump has championed: immigration, central authority, defense.

UPDATE: Leftists on twitter concerned about stock markets. For the first time ever.
