Ed Martin Jr. and I got together again to talk about why you might give yourself Permission to Trump. It's important that you do.

This week's episode focuses on:




** FBI Director's report on Hillary Clinton's illegal and dangerous abuse of classified information
** The horrific massacre of police officers in Dallas
** Bill's new book,** [Turning On Trump](https://amzn.to/29qDOYw)**


Feel free to share this post with all your friends. They might like a copy of [**Turning On Trump**](https://amzn.to/29qDOYw), too.
