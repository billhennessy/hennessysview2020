Last year about this time, [Business Insider asked 13 Wall Street analysts](https://www.businessinsider.com/wall-street-2015-sp-500-forecasts-2015-1) where the S&P 500 would stand at close of trading today.

For background, the S&P 500 began the year at 2058.9. The mean guess for closing number was 2212 with a standard deviation of 83.

Here's the ugly chart: 



Three of the guesses--Oppenheimer, RBC, and Fundstrat--were more than 3 standard deviations from the actual close of 2050.

Fundstrat's Tom Lee, the most overzealous guesser, expected capex to drive the S&P 500 t0 a whopping 2325. [But we know how that turned out](https://hennessysview.com/2015/12/31/2016-bad-year/).

Your Turn

Where will S&P 500 close to end 2016?

I'll guess 1241.
