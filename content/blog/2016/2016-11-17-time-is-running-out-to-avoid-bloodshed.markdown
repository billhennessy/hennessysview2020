Every day[ teachers beat students who like Trump](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/11/student-paddled-writing-trump-blackboard-school-banned-election-talk/).

Every day anti-Trump social justice warriors (SJWs) [beat](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/11/high-school-girl-pummeled-scratched-thrown-ground-stomped-supporting-trump-video/), [shoot](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/11/atlanta-man-shot-dead-outside-bar-telling-hispanic-man-trump-going-deport/), and [kill](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/11/young-father-4-year-old-dies-anti-trump-protesters-block-roads-hospital/) Trump supporters.

Every day, anti-Trump SJWs [vandalize and harass businesses.](https://wtop.com/prince-william-county/2016/03/local-trump-supporter-says-shes-facing-harassment-vandalism/slide/1/)

Every day, anti-Trump reporters lie.

And the anti-trumpets better change. Fast. Or there will be hell to pay.

People will put up with harassment and violence only so long.

People eventually push back.

People who fight as a last resort fight for their lives.

Stop the harassment or suffer the consequences of your evil decisions, Democrats. It's that simple.

I'm not advocating or endorsing violence. I'm telling you how it is. Â I'm old enough to know how this shit works. And you're working against yourselves right now.
