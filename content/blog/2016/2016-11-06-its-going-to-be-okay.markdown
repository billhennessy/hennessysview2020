You might be stressing out when you learn that James Comey sent another letter to Congress. In case you didn't hear, he did. And he said that the emails found on Huma Abedin's computer did not change his earlier conclusion about Hillary Clinton.

It's easy to panic or get mad or dejected. Totally understandable. But that's totally counterproductive, too. And being mad or acting dispirited is just what the elites want us to do. They want us to panic because chaos is their friend.

Everything that was wrong with Hillary Clinton is still wrong with her.

Everything that inspired people to support Trump still remains true.

Nothing has changed. It's going to be okay. It's going to be okay as long as you follow through on your commitments. Be consistent with the results you want, and you will get the outcomes you need.

If you feel angry, upset, or scared, you're reacting naturally. It's normal for you to feel the way you do.

If you want to **do something** about the way you feel, here are three simple suggestions:




*1. Fill out a sample ballot online. Consider this a rehearsal for the real thing on Tuesday. Just go to this website: [https://vote-usa.org](https://vote-usa.org), enter your address, and vote. You probably feel better already, don't you?
*2. Share your sample ballot on Facebook and Twitter. You can even email your ballot to me bill@billhennessy.com. I don't know if I'll have time to respond before Tuesday, but it feels better to share the vote. You might feel like you're being heard because you are.
*3. Tell the world you're [voting for Trump, Blunt, and Greitens](https://hennessysview.com/2016/11/06/how-to-win-consistently/) online. Send a lot of tweets with those names. You can even cc me [@whennessy](https://twitter.com/whennessy). I like hearing that people are doing something instead of just complaining


Those are the 3 things you can do right now. Tuesday you can vote for real.

No matter, it's going to be okay. We know how it ends: the good guys win. Source: [Revelation](https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__P135.HTM).
