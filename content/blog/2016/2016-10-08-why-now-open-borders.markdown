You might have heard that the [Clinton campaign released the 2005 audio of Donald Trump](https://hennessysview.com/2016/10/08/clinton-vs-trump-on-women/) on Friday to affect Sunday's debate.

Maybe, but not likely. It's more likely that the story dropped to cover up the latest Hillary email scandal. Gwen Ifill agrees (via [Breitbart](https://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/10/08/gwen-ifill-absent-the-trump-audio-wed-be-paying-a-lot-more-attention-to-hillary-speech-revelations/)):



> we would have been paying attention a lot more tonight to some revelations from WikiLeaks about Hillary Clinton’s email — her latest email tranche from the State Department. And in this case, it’s answering the question that [Sen.] Bernie Sanders (I-VT) raised during the primaries, which is what did you say in those speeches when nobody was listening, the speeches you were paid for? He never could get an answer, but it looks like we have a partial answer tonight.



Perhaps the most damning piece of that email tranche was **Hillary's push for "open borders."** That bombshell makes Clinton a liar, makes her running mate a liar, and makes the media "fact checkers" either liars or idiots. Maybe both.

Every time Trump or Pence has said Hillary supports open borders, their opponents, including the media, say it's not true. Here's **[the morons at PolitiFact](https://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2016/jun/23/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-hillary-clinton-would-create-tot/) proving they're either in Hillary's corner or just stupid**:



> **Claiming that Clinton would create "totally open borders" is a serious charge** that suggests allowing people to travel freely or with very few restrictions between two countries.

. . .

**That’s not what Clinton has proposed.** Clinton has supported legislation that includes a path to citizenship (with conditions) and included heightened border security. As a candidate, she says she will focus on deportations of criminals.



But Trump and Pence are right and PolitiFact was wrong. (PolitiFact is wrong a lot.) Hillary wants open borders. Here's what she told Brazilian businessmen in a private speech that you were not supposed to learn about, via [LifeZette](https://www.lifezette.com/polizette/wikileaks-dump-hillary-dreams-open-trade-open-borders/):



> "My dream is a hemispheric** common market**, with open trade and** open borders**, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere," Clinton told Banco Itau, a Brazilian bank, on May 16, 2013.



Wikileaks confirmed that Hillary supports what PolitiFact considers "a serious charge." She's guilty.

When Trump and Pence say Hillary wants open borders, they're telling the truth. When Hillary, Kaine, and the corrupt Washington Post deny open borders, they're lying. Hillary will push for open borders if she were to become president, and spineless Paul Ryan would help her. (Paul Ryan is the property of the same Wall Street owners as Hillary. They're on the same team.)
