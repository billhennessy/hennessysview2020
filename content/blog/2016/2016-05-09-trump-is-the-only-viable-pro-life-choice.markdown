Some pro-life activists like Erick Erickson are plotting ways to sabotage Donald Trump's candidacy for president. They probably haven't stopped to think. If they succeed in defeating Trump, they will be culpable in many, many abortions. That's a lot of guilt for a guy like Erickson to carry around, isn't it?

Chances are Congress won't introduce any major abortion laws in the next four years. That means the abortion battle will remain in the courts.

The Supreme Court is made up of four relatively conservative justices and four relatively liberal ones. That means there's a vacancy on the court. Antonin Scalia died in February, leaving an open seat. Scalia was probably the most conservative justice. (For a breakdown on [the Supreme Court's ideological future, click](https://hennessysview.com/2016/04/02/strategist-looks-supreme-court-nomination/).) President Obama appointed a replacement for Scalia, but the Senate probably won't vote on that nomination.

That means **the next president will appoint Scalia's replacement**, and that appointment will decide whether the court goes mostly right or mostly left.

Now, we can't say for sure whether the GOP or Democrats will control the next Senate. But we can accurately predict this: **if Clinton is the next president, the Supreme Court will be mostly liberal for a generation**.

Clinton is a big fan of abortion on demand, and she's vowed to appoint judges and justices who will overrule state and federal laws that restrict abortions. I know Hillary lies a lot, but I bet she's telling the truth about this.

Donald Trump says he's working with the Heritage Foundation to create a list of excellent conservative jurists to replace Scalia and any other vacancies that occur during his presidency. He's even open to appointing Ted Cruz to the Supreme Court. That probably means a Trump win keeps the high court mostly conservative.

I have no way of knowing how many more abortions will happen if Clinton wins, but I'm pretty confident in predicting that **a Clinton win mean more unborn babies will die than if Trump wins**.

If you're pro-life, the choice is pretty simple: support Trump or the baby gets it.
