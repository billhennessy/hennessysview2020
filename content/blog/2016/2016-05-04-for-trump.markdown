I'm for Trump.

I like stating the positive.

So I'm for Trump.

The[ NR Against Trump writers](https://hennessysview.com/2016/01/22/trumps-conservative-critics-dont-get-it/) can own it if Hillary wins and appoints [a Supreme Court justice who's to the left of Bader-Ginsberg ](https://hennessysview.com/2016/02/13/suddenly-2012-becomes-more-relevant-than-2016/)as Scalia's replacement. They'll take that to their graves.

For me, I'm for Trump. I'll admit [he wasn't my first choice](https://hennessysview.com/2015/08/24/trump-good-bad-and-ugly/), but he was far from my last choice. My first choice, Ben Carson, endorsed The Donald.

Trump seems to love America and Americans. His kids love him. His ex-wife endorsed him. And he has a history of accomplishing things everybody else thought hopeless.

A lot of people think America is hopeless, but Trump thinks he can fix it. Why not give him this chance? No one else has a plausible plan to fix our country. Trump's plan might be a little vague, but it's still viable. Everybody else's was dead on arrival. And who doesn't want to make America great again? Reagan did.

So I'm for Trump. [How bad could it be](https://hennessysview.com/2016/02/24/why-so-many-conservatives-are-wrong-about-trump/)?

I'm working on a longer post. Look for it on Sunday. But this one pretty much sums up my feelings and thoughts tonight, the night Americans rejected the political elite and took a chance on someone different from anything we've seen before.

I'm for America.

I'm for Trump.
