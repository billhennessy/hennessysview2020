Admit it: words trump action. And words trump results.

No one really cares what you do or the consequences of your actions. They care about what you say.

That's what we learned in school, right? That action is cheap but words are priceless. You probably memorized this nursery rhyme:



> Verbs and nouns
Can break our crowns
But deeds can never hurt us.



There was another nursery rhyme with the same meter and opposite meaning. It was subversive. You should never, ever think of that rhyme again. Because we know now that words, not actions, matter above all else.

Don't believe me? Silly child. Think about this.



### Sexism



Donald Trump insults people who attack him. Some of the people who attack him are women, so Trump insults some women. That makes him sexist, right?

We all know that [Donald Trump has one of the best records in business for hiring and promoting women ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/donald-trump-a-champion-of-women-his-female-employees-think-so/2015/11/23/7eafac80-88da-11e5-9a07-453018f9a0ec_story.html)to significant jobs in his company. If there's a glass ceiling in the Trump Organization, it's because a woman designed it and installed it. We all know that.

But that's _action_. That's a _result_. What matters is words, not actions.

His words hurt Rosie O'Donnell's feelings, so he must be a sexist. Verbs and nouns can break our crows, but deeds can never hurt us.



### Racism



Donald Trump insults people who attack him. Some of the people who attack him are not of European ancestry, so Trump insults people of color. That makes him a racist, right?

We all know that Donald Trump has one of the best records in business for his treatment of minorities. He turned a formerly "closed" country club in Florida into an "open" club that accepts blacks, Jews, and women as members. Decades ago. He almost got kicked out of Florida for letting the Jews in, remember?

But that's _action_. That's _result_. What matters is words, not actions. Actions don't count in America, only words do.

His words hurt Judge Curiel's feelings, so he must be a racist. Even though Mexico is a country, not a race . . . yeah, but still. Verbs and nouns can break our crowns, but deeds can never hurt us.



### Grow Up



If you live your life by nursery rhymes, you probably need psychiatric help.

If you believe words are more important than deeds, you're probably beyond treatment.

Donald Trump built a successful company that [**employs 34,000 people**](https://money.cnn.com/2015/09/03/news/economy/donald-trump-jobs-created/). His company has [more women executives](https://dailycaller.com/2015/08/17/attorney-trump-companies-employ-more-female-execs-than-male-video/) than men executives. His daughter, not his sons, runs the company now. And a huge percentage of those 34,000 employees are Hispanic or other immigrants.

Trump's actions improve lives.

Once in a while, Trump's words hurt the feelings of very, very sensitive people. Very touchy people, like Holden Caulfield's parents. (Touchy as hell.)

Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton sold out America to Russia for cash. That's action. No one cares about that action. Because, in America today, words speak louder than action.

Put your mouth where my money is. (I carry a front-pocket wallet.)

Clinton also called you a racist if you don't vote for her in Novmeber. Words speak louder than actions.

Perhaps you'll listen now.
