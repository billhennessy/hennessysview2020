Politico announced Tuesday: **Clinton's Advisors Tell Her to Prep for a Landslide**

Inquisitor said the same day: **Hillary Clinton Campaign Preparing for a Landslide**

The stories beneath those headlines spoke of the intense hubris inside the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign. Their "experts" declared the race over on Tuesday. Assured of a landslide, Clinton stopped campaigning and turned to what the Clinton's do best: extorting money from the ultra-rich.

(Politico toned down its exuberant headline after Trump's triumph in Mexico City.)

You have to wonder if Hillary's minions are still popping champagne.

Two major polls, the LA Times and [Reuters](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/09/trump-leads-hillary-clinton-3-points-latest-revelations-corruption-lies/), now show Trump surging up, up, and away from her crookedness.




** Trump's remarkable surge follows the best week by a Presidential candidate in living memory.
** alongside Mexican President Enrique PeñaNieto on Wednesday
** Trump gave the most detailed policy speech by any candidate so far this election cycle on Wednesday evening
** [Trump received a standing ovation](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/09/video-donald-trump-receives-standing-ovation-detroit-great-faith-ministries-church/) from the congregation of a black church in Detroit on Saturday
** Trump hosted numerous rallies for ordinary folk in between


Meanwhile, weak and crooked Hilary convalesced at her mansion and made a few trips out to take money from celebrity millionaires like a Noël Coward character. Hillary dodged indictment by the FBI, again, after a holiday weekend document dump of portions of the FBI report on Hillary's unindicted crimes against national security.

Another week of contrasts this stark, and people will be saying [Trump is effectively running unopposed](https://hennessysview.com/2016/09/03/just-pretend-for-a-moment/).
