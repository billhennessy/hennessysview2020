**UPDATE: The [Gateway Pundit has confirmed Donald Trump will attend Phyllis Schlafly's funeral](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/09/breaking-donald-trump-attend-phyllis-schlafly-funeral-express-condolences/) in St. Louis.**

If you're glad Ronald Reagan was once President, you should thank Phyllis Schlafly.

Unfortunately, Mrs. Schlafly passed away, so you can't thank her personally. But you can celebrate her life and her swift entrance to heaven.

**This Saturday at 2:00pm, the ones she left behind will gather at the Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis (New Cathedral), 4431 Lindell Blvd. St. Louis, MO 63108, for her funeral mass. **

Even the huge and ornate Cathedral seems too small and plain to celebrate Phyllis's life properly. The GOP convention seemed a better fit. She was there, of course, cheering on Donald Trump as she had since last December.

As I wrote [here](https://hennessysview.com/2015/12/20/its-time-to-choose/) and [here](https://hennessysview.com/2016/09/05/phyllis-schlafly-rip/), Phyllis's support for Trump was instrumental in turning me. Who knows—maybe the Donald will pop by the Cathedral to pay his last respects. He owes her so much, really. She lent him legitimacy with the conservative base.

If you can't make the mass, you might want to [read her last book](https://amzn.to/2c3zrKf), co-authored with my friend Ed Martin. It's wonderful. _[The Conservative Case for Trump](https://amzn.to/2c3zrKf). _
