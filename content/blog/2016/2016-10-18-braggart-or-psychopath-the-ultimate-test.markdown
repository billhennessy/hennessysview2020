Some people have already decided which candidate to vote for. According to polls, slightly more people favor the psychopath over the braggart.

For the undecided, I thought I'd create a simple quiz that will tell you whether you're more comfortable with a President who says ugly things and brags about accomplishments or a president who gets people killed and gives away national secrets for cash. I know, it's a tough call.
