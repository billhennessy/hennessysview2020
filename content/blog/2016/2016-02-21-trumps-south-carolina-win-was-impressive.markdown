I got tire of scrolling.

Politico shows the results of [each county in South Carolina](https://www.politico.com/2016-election/results/map/president/south-carolina), my state of residence from 1985 to 1992.

Abbeville: Trump

Aiken: Trump

Allendale: Trump

Anderson: Trump

Bamberg: Trump

Barnwell: Trump

Beaufort: Trump

Berkeley: Trump

It goes on and on and on.

Donald Trump not only won the geography, [he won the demography](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/primaries/south-carolina-exit-poll/):

Evangelical Christians: Trump

Born-again Christians: Trump

Conservative Voters: Trump

Moderate Voters: Trump

Young Voters: Trump

Old Voters: Trump

First-time Voters: Trump

Veterans/Military: Trump

Women: Trump

Men: Trump

High School Grads: Trump

College Grads: Trump

It goes on and on and on like Journey song.

Granted, there are demographic/psychographic groups Trump did not win, but very view. Rubio did better among post-grad folks. Cruz did better among people very conservative voters. But the breadth of Trump's win is staggering. And he did the same thing in New Hampshire. He won all the major demographics and almost all the counties.

Donald Trump has now won New Hampshire and South Carolina by double digits. His chances of winning the nomination are above 80 percent, probably closer to 90 percent.

**It's time for Republicans and Republican-leaners to start dealing with the probability that Donald J. Trump will be the party's standard-bearer in 2016.**

Since 1996, ordinary Americans have warned the political and corporate elites not to ignore their plight. But the elites didn't listen.

[They're listening now](https://hennessysview.com/2016/02/20/this-is-the-gen-x-election/).
