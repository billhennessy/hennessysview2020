You might have heard that State Senator Dave Schatz gutted ethics reform in Missouri. According to Ryan Johnson of [Missouri Alliance for Freedom](https://www.missourifreedom.com):



> Cleaning up the practice of Jefferson City’s revolving door is the reason for Rep. Caleb Rowden’s [House Bill 1979](https://missourifreedom.us10.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=2a23358875aa1838bc974c743&id=1a969cb5f4&e=23eaa27bc8) (carried in the Senate by Sen. Bob Onder). It puts in place a one year cooling off period that will make legislators sit out for at least a year before lobbying. It passed the House early and with overwhelming support.

It was the Senate that gutted his bill.** [Senator Dave Schatz, R-Sullivan](https://missourifreedom.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=2a23358875aa1838bc974c743&id=6e9735724c&e=23eaa27bc8), offered an [amendment](https://missourifreedom.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=2a23358875aa1838bc974c743&id=0350b5acc4&e=23eaa27bc8) to strip out the one year cooling off period making the bill worthless**. His amendment passed and for now the [revolving door](https://missourifreedom.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=2a23358875aa1838bc974c743&id=8070c6a02c&e=23eaa27bc8) remains open.

Adding insult to injury the Senate played cute by allowing his amendment to have a vote by the practice of standing division. This means **there is no written record of who voted to gut the revolving door bill except ours**. It helps that we are in the Capitol watching.



Here's what I wrote to my State Senator Dave Schatz:



> Senator,

Why did you gut the the ethics reform bill?

I understand you pushed the amendment to remove the one-year cooling off period from HB 1979, making the law meaningless. Why would you do that?

Missouri is the wild west of revolving-door politics, as you know. By gutting a common sense ethics reform bill, you seem to say, "I like cronyism more than I like good government."

As a voter and activist in your district, I find your position disturbing, and I look forward to your next appearance on the ballot. Then again, you probably do, too. **With Missouri's revolving door, win one time and you're set for life. **

Sincerely,
Bill Hennessy



Other Republicans who supported Schatz's amendment and opposed clean government include:

• Senator Ed Emery
• Senator Mike Kehoe
• Senator Doug Libla
• Senator Wayne Wallingford
• Senator Paul Wieland

Let's give these Senators a swift kick through that revolving door. Maybe they'll do less damage as lobbyists than as legislators.
