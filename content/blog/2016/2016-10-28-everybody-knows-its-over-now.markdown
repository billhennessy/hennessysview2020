My phone was vibrating like a like a sex toy all afternoon. I couldn't look. I was with a client and teammates working on serious business.

When I got a break, after the client left, I locked myself in a bathroom stall and looked at the messages.



> Comey is reopening Hillary investigation

New emails have been found



I didn't believe it, so I looked at [The Gateway Pundit](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com):

As Madelaine Kahn said in Blazing Saddles, "It's twue, it's twue!" Hillary's bodies wouldn't stay buried.

Some anti-Trumpers are telling themselves, "this too shall pass." Don't count on it.

James Comey wouldn't admit he was wrong unless . . . he had no choice. Overwhelming evidence of criminality. Even Watergate reporter and Hillary fan Carl Bernstein agrees. [Comey had to act. Via Breitbart](https://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/10/28/bernstein-comey-wouldnt-have-made-clinton-email-announcement-unless-it-needed-serious-investigation/):



> On Friday’s broadcast of “CNN Newsroom,” author, journalist, CNN Political Commentator Carl Bernstein stated that the FBI taking another look at Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s emails is “a real bombshell.” and that **FBI Director James Comey wouldn’t have made the announcement “unless it was something requiring serious investigation.”**

Bernstein said, “We don’t know what this means yet, except that it’s a real bombshell. And it is unthinkable that the director of the FBI would take this action lightly, that he would put this letter forth to the Congress of the United States saying that there is more information out there about classified emails, and call it to the attention of Congress unless it was something requiring serious investigation.”



Berstein is dead right. By re-opening the criminal investigation of Hillary Clinton, he admitted that his earlier "all clear" was premature.

No one seriously thinks Clinton can win, now, absent massive fraud and a totally rigged election. Or complacency.

And my sense is that Trump voters can't wait to vote. They're lining up around the block in Florida. People are dying to make America great again.

Voters have a clear choice: take a chance on the guy who wants to make America great again, or climb into bed with a criminal. There's no third choice.

My prediction stands:[ Trump wins 375 electoral-vote landslide on November 8](https://hennessysview.com/2016/05/13/how-to-predict-trumps-landslide-win/).
