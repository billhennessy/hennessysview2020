According to [Michelle](https://michellemalkin.com/2008/03/22/will-any-american-company-host-fitna/), (h/t [allahpundit](https://hotair.com/archives/2008/03/22/hosting-company-pulls-the-plug-on-geert-wilderss-anti-islam-movie/))Network Solutions, a wimp of web hosting known for overcharging customers ($35 for a domain name registration), brought down the web site promoting Geert Wilder's new film, Fitna: the movie, citing complaints from rag-head terrorists.

I say, let's bring down Network Solutions, the Herndon, Virginia-based Internet serviced provider. The company was recently purchased by [General Atlantic](https://www.generalatlantic.com/usa/people/team.asp?sb=p), who should hear from you. (CEO is William E. Ford. Chairman is Stephen A. Denning.) The company would love to hear from you:

In the meantime, Hennessy's View would be proud to serve as a mirror for the film. If you don't think we're all pussies, yet, then check this out from [Stop the ACLU](https://stoptheaclu.com/archives/2008/03/03/free-expression-quashed-youtube-removes-blasphemies-against-islam/).
