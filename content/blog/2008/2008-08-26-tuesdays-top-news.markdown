The University of Illinois releases the Obama-Ayers papers tomorrow.  Don't expect the MSM to mention it--unless it's good news for Obama.

Meanwhile, Obama has asked the Department of Justice to block ads that link the Illinois Senator to domestic terrorist William Ayers.  [Pathetic](https://www.politico.com/news/stories/0808/12816.html).



> Obama’s campaign has written the Department of Justice demanding a criminal investigation of the “American Issues Project,” the vehicle through which Dallas investor Harold Simmons is financing the advertisements. The Obama campaign — and tens of thousands of supporters — also is pressuring television networks and affiliates to reject the ads. The effort has met with some success: CNN and Fox News are not airing the attacks.



But [MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/obama-campaign-launches-desperate-misleading/story.aspx?guid=%7B6DA09B12-7DDB-472F-98B4-2E4EBEA173B8%7D&dist=hppr) reports that a counter-ad by Obama is misleading and fails to address the issues raised in Simmons's ad.



> The Obama campaign has launched a new ad that fails to dispute a single fact in the American Issues Project's initial ad questioning Barack Obama's relationship with admitted domestic terrorist, William Ayers.



We shall see.  I'll report on the Obama-Ayers Papers if the MSM won't.
