Barack Obama told the world what he thinks of rural people, and, in so doing, sealed his fate [from [Powerline](https://www.powerlineblog.com/archives2/2008/04/020274.php)]:

If you're surprised that Obama could be so . . . so elitist, then you don't know many liberals, and you don't know any well. Liberalism _is_ elitism. That elitism is what Buckley spoke of when he said, "I'd rather be ruled by the first 200 names in the Boston telephone book than by the 200 members of the faculty of Harvard University."

 

Obama surrounded himself with a racist wife and a racist mentor in Jeremiah Wright. In [Ed Morrissey's](https://hotair.com/archives/2008/04/11/this-is-why-rookies-shouldnt-run-for-president/) thoughtful post on HotAir, he writes:

We saw hints of this from Michelle Obama, in her assertions about never being proud of her country until her husband ran for President.

Barack taught himself bigotry and elitism in fine universities and pompous periodicals. He traded his race for a shot at the big time. His immaturity and inexperience prevent him from burying his prejudices, his weaknesses, and his pathetic judgment.

 

Obama is a lightweight. He's not so smart. He's a pedestrian liberal who made the mistake of buying into his own press.
