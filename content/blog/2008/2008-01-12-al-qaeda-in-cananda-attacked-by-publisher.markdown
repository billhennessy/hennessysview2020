Al Qaeda in Canada, officially known as the Alberta Human Rights Commission, is persecuting Ezra Levant, former publisher of a magazine called [The Western Standard](https://westernstandard.blogs.com/shotgun/2006/03/western_standar.html), now defunct.  His crime, according to the Commission, was publishing [the famous Mohammed cartoons that originally appeared in a Danish Magazine](https://www.zombietime.com/mohammed_image_archive/jyllands-posten_cartoons/).

[Levant was ordered ](https://www.canada.com/topics/news/story.html?id=6edbee05-bec3-46c0-aa22-f16cf3f0acb1&k=90175)against his will to appear before the Commission on Friday, January 10.  He began with a compelleing opening statement that made the Commission sound like a collection of Nazi boobs hellbent on destroying the right of political speech and to advance the cause of radical Islam in Canada.  The Commission offered no defense or refutation of the charges.  (See the video of Lavant's statement on [RightWingNews](https://www.canada.com/topics/news/story.html?id=6edbee05-bec3-46c0-aa22-f16cf3f0acb1&k=90175).)

Canadians should be embarrassed by their government.  Muslims should grow thicker skins.  They worship a god who, they claim, encourages and thrills at the mutilation of innocents.  For such inhuman people, mere cartoons are a mild punishment.

> OK, it should be flamingly obvious that Mark Levant's hearing before the Canadian Human Rights Commission for having the audacity to exercise his right to free speech and free press to publish the infamous Mohammed Cartoons are going to be a high point in the struggle for freedom against Islamofascism and the nanny state.


And that's not all!  More WizBangers are onto this story:  Another story by [Jay Tea](https://wizbangblog.com/content/2008/01/13/the-biffli-rule.php) and still another by [Jim Addison](https://wizbangblog.com/content/2008/01/13/o-canada-puhleeze.php).  Perhaps the embarrassment will inspire Canada to dissolve its poorly named Human Rights Commission.  Or, at least, change the name to Al Qaeda in Canada.
