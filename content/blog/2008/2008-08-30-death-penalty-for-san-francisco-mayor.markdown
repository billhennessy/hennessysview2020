Danielle Bologna's trembles like an injured child's when she approaches the word, "widow."

"I never thought I'd used that word about myself," she recently told an interviewer.

Bologna is a widow. She's also the grieving mother of two sons. On June 22, 2008, a wild, crazed killer wiped out Mrs. Bologna's family as they returned home from a family picnic. Tony, husband and father; Michael, 20 years, sone; Matthew, 16 years, son. Murdered in cold blood for the sport of it. Shot to death in a city with notoriously strict gun laws. A family of four became a family of one.

The murderer, Edwin Ramos, is an illegal alien living in San Francisco at the personal invitation and under the protection of [Mayor Gavin Newsome](https://astoldbyjen.wordpress.com/2008/07/24/gavin-newsome-quite-possibly-the-most-despicable-politician-ever/). From the [San Francisco Chronicle](https://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/07/19/MNK011MAFR.DTL&tsp=1):

> Ramos, a native of El Salvador whom prosecutors say is a member of a violent street gang, was found guilty of two felonies as a juvenile - a gang-related assault on a Muni passenger and the attempted robbery of a pregnant woman - according to authorities familiar with his background.  
> 
> In neither instance did officials with the city's Juvenile Probation Department alert federal immigration authorities, because it was the city agency's policy not to 
> 
> consider immigration status when deciding how to deal with an offender.
>

Since the murders and arrest of Ramos, [Newsome continues to defend the policy](https://gavinnewsomsucks.blogspot.com/2008/08/blood-on-newsoms-hands.html), protecting and inviting more illegal alien murders into the United States and into San Francisco. Newsome never offered an apology to Mrs. Bologna. He refuses to consider complying with federal law. He did not attend the funerals, send flowers, or grieve. Instead, he [partied in Montana](https://www.topix.com/forum/living/wedding/TMNB3OGDKGOK2IH9T).

Gavin Newsome is the [proximate cause of the Bologna murders](https://capoliticalnews.com/s/spip.php?breve5967), just as Charles Manson was the proximate cause of the Tate and LaBianca murders. Only a temporary judicial anomaly spared Manson the electric chair. Nothing but a quick trial should stand between Gavin Newsome and the needle.

Gavin Newsome deserves to die, along with every official who supported and complied with Newsome's deadly immigration policy.

But how whacked are San Francisco and California? Newsome, the modern day Charles Manson, might just be the [state's next governor](https://politics.ohio.com/2008/07/22/510/).

You liberals wanted sanctuary cities. We conservatives told you they would destroy us. We were right, as always.
