[Biden to Lead Task Force on Expanding Middle Class - FOXNews.com Transition Tracker](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2008/12/21/biden-lead-task-force-expanding-middle-class/)  


> As vice president, Joe Biden will oversee an Obama administration effort to find ways of building up the ranks of the middle class, that ambiguously defined segment of society most Americans identify with.

What does "expanding the middle class" entail, exactly? The government has spent tens of trillions of dollars trying to elevate the poor to middle class. That doesn't work, obviously. One must assume, then, that the way Obama and his trusty sidekick Biden intend to inflate the middle is by squeezing the top.   
  
In other words, the Democrats plan to make people poorer in order to grow the middle.   
  
We call this communism and its method is thievery. Unfortunately, the lazy, timid American masses will eat it up. Save for certain areas in the south and west, America is a the land of the bound and home of the coward.   
  
This "expanding the middle class" non-speak goes along with the idiotic statement Barack makes about "preserving 3 million jobs."   
  
Just what the fuck does that mean? He doesn't speak of creating 3 million new jobs, but of defending and preserving 3 million existing jobs. In other words, if more than 3 million people have jobs at any point during his administration, he can claim success. Some hope and change.
