method, Nozbe is free for basic activity.  If you're busy enough to need [Nozbe](https://www.nozbe.com/a-7B163710), you'll probably need one of the fee-based accounts, though. Combine [Nozbe](https://www.nozbe.com/a-7B163710) with [Jott.com](https://www.jott.com).  Jott is a free service that allows you to manage your life from your phone.  You call the 866 number, state the name of the person or system ("nozbe") you want to Jott, then leave a voice mail.  Jott transcribed the message and forwards it to [Nozbe](https://www.nozbe.com/a-7B163710), your e-mail box, someone else's e-mail, or a cell phone.  You can even blog via Jott.  (Look at the Links page for about 20 programs that Jott interfaces with.)If you haven't read [Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0142000280?ie=UTF8&tag=hennesssview-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0142000280)![](https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=hennesssview-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0142000280)
