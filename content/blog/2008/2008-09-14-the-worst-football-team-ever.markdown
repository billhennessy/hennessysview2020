The title probably belongs to the 2008 St. Louis Rams. 

 

For the second week in a row, a team without serious injuries humiliated itself, its city, and the players' families on national television.

 

Defense, offense, and special teams were sickeningly lackadaisical and inept. It was like watching squirrels do trigonometry.

 

If I owned this team, the entire coaching staff would be fired tonight.
