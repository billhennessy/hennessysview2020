Former governor Mitt Romney has won the Wyoming Caucuses.  Romney has 6 of the 12 delegates up for grabs.  Two other delegates are split between Thompson and Duncan Hunter.  With 4 delegates to be decided, that leaves Romney with a lock.

Nonetheless, if Thompson could pick up 3 of the remaining 4, it would be a banner day for the true conservative voice.

The Wyoming GOP has an [Excel spreadsheet ](https://www.wygop.org/images/wy/nine%20da%202008%20form.xls)showing the candidate favored in each county.  You'll have to ignore counties with Alternates, as only the Delegates count.  (I figured this out because I know Wyoming has 12 delegates, but there are 24 counties listed--half the counties are alternates.)
