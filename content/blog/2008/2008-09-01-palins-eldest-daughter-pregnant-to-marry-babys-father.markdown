Sarah Palin's eldest daughter, Bristol, is pregnant and will marry Levi, the child's father, Todd and Sarah said today in a press release [[FoxNews.com](https://elections.foxnews.com/2008/09/01/palins-17-year-old-daughter-is-pregnant/)].


> The 17-year-old unwed daughter of John McCain’s new running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, is five-months pregnant, Palin and her husband, Todd Palin, said Monday in a written statement.

McCain’s campaign told FOX News that the presumptive Republican presidential candidate knew about Bristol Palin’s pregnancy before he chose Palin as his running mate last Friday, and that Bristol is planning to marry the father of her child.


The Palins felt compelled to release the information to dispel [idiotic left-wing reports](https://michellemalkin.com/2008/08/31/palin-derangement-syndrome/) that Palin [faked her own pregnancy](https://hotair.com/archives/2008/09/01/a-picture-refutes-a-thousand-nutcase-conspiracies/) to cover the pregnancy of Bristol.

The left will have a field day with this, mostly because liberals consider the voluntary murder of children through abortion every woman's responsibility.  By marrying the father and raising her baby, Bristol Palin will demonstrate everything liberals hate.

**Momentum Impact**

This news should not slow the momentum McCain has picked up since announcing Palin as his choice for Vice President.  It highlights the evil hatred of liberals who forced a private family matter onto the front page by creating unfounded rumors and treating them as fact.

While the publicity of the situation will put strains on the Palin family, it has nothing to do with Sarah Palin's fitness for office.  Moreover, by marrying and raising the child, Bristol exemplifies the pro-life stance her mother has held throughout her public life.

UPDATE:  [Allahpundit](https://hotair.com/archives/2008/09/01/oy-palins-daughter-is-pregnant/) has more.
