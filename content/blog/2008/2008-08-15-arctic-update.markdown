[Steven Goddard ](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/08/15/goddard_arctic_ice_mystery/)has an update on Arctic sea ice levels, and it looks like the skeptics are right.Â 

He also found that the National Snow and Ice Data Center (leftist) is falsified its graph to show more melt than actually occured.

The most certain equation in science is L = l(f) where L = lie, l = liberal, and f = "fact."
