Many on the right claim they'll vote Democrat if McCain chooses a pro-choice veep.  

I'm as anti-abortion as anyone on the planet.  I think my perseverating brethren need to learn their conservative roots.  

George H. W. Bush was pro-choice when Regan chose him as veep.

Settle down, [Michelle](https://michellemalkin.com/2008/08/20/mccain-refuses-to-defuse-rumors-about-pro-choice-vp-pick/).  McCain's White House would be more pro-life than [Obama's](https://michellemalkin.com/2008/08/21/chilling-obamas-concern-for-abortionists-burden/).  Take what you can get.
