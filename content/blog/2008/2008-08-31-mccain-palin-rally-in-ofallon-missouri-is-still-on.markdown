We're getting ready to head out to the McCain Rally in O'Fallon, Missouri.  I just checked with the campaign and the rally is still on.  John McCain is stopping in New Orleans to check on hurricane preparations before the rally, so I wouldn't be surprised if it starts late.

I'll have photos and a report on the events this evening.
