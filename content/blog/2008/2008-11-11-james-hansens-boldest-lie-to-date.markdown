Dr. Hansen apparently believes the world is as stupid as, well, as stupid as the world seems to be.

 

All of the October surface station temperature from Russia was corrupted. So what did Hansen do? He simply [copied and pasted Russia's temperatures for September](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2008/11/10/giss-releases-october-2008-data/) into October and reported that October 2008 was the hottest October on record.

 

Why isn't James Hansen in prison? The AGW argument has lost so much steam that he's resorted this level of lying, fraud, and deceit. So fast are the data disproving Hansen's theories that he'll stoop to bald faced lies to protect his crumbling reputation. 

 

Meanwhile, 2008 is shaping up to be [below average](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/2008/oct/01_10_2008_DvTempRank_pg.gif) across the vast majority of the United States.

**UPDATE: The outrage and call for action spreads:

 

    * Ed Morrissey at [HotAir](https://hotair.com/archives/2008/11/16/hottest-october-on-record-was-really-a-september/)** [Tom Nelson](https://tomnelson.blogspot.com/2008/11/power-line-red-hot-october-as.html)** Mark Noonan at [Blogs for Victory](https://blogsforvictory.com/2008/11/16/global-warming-update-19/)** [Gateway Pundit](https://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2008/11/brrrr-nasa-reports-bogus-global-warming.html)  

Ed Morrissey is exactly correct. GISS has a long and accelerating record of [changing history](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2008/11/14/the-evolution-of-the-giss-temperature-product/) to fit its models, of publishing doctored climate data, and of [encouraging criminal activity](https://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/14581) to hide its own corruption. One of the great errors of the 2008 election was the failure of both political parties to treat the AGW scam as a massive criminal enterprise. Perhaps the peasants with pitch-forks will have to prosecute this crime themselves.
