The ad asks, "[Why not Hillary](https://elections.foxnews.com/2008/08/24/mccain-camp-accuses-obama-of-passing-over-clinton-for-vp/)?"  It provides the answer:  Hillary told the truth about Obama, and the child-candidate didn't like it.

The McCain campaign's [marketing brilliance ](https://hennessysview.com/2008/08/21/mccain-might-just-win-this-thing/)continues to amaze.  I had no idea he would be [this adept](https://voices.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/08/23/mccain_tries_to_rile_up_clinto.html) at modern campaigning.  With this ad, McCain will foment the still-simmering anger among Clinton's most loyal supporters, as demonstrated in this [Washington Times article](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/aug/23/clinton-supporters-split-over-biden-as-vp/).
