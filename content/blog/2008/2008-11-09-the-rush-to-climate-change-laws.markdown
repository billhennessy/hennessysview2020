According to reports, Barack Obama will spend most of the afternoon of January 20, 2009, [signing Executive Orders](https://hotair.com/archives/2008/11/09/obama-to-target-bush-executive-orders-in-first-days/) to ban or limit activities that produce CO2. Bankrupting the coal and steel industries apparently can't wait for legislative action.

Why the rush? Why is Obama in such a hurry to put tens of thousands of people out of work?

Obama and the left want to get CO2 laws in place so they can claim the laws stopped and reversed global warming.

Temperatures have been dropping for 8 years and have not risen in 11 years. Moreover, the coming winter could be one of the worst in recent memory. The Arctic Sea ice buildup is nearly equal to 1980 in extent and exceeds 1980 in density [[click](https://igloo.atmos.uiuc.edu/cgi-bin/test/print.sh?fm=11&fd=08&fy=1980&sm=11&sd=08&sy=2008)]. Already, the extent exceeds any in the past six years [[click](https://icecap.us/images/uploads/Arctic_Ice_Extent_Now_Likely_Highest_Level_Since_2002.pdf)].

Most people are "concerned" about anthropogenic global warming can't spell CO2, much less know that temperatures are falling and sea ice increasing. Those people will accept that an Executive Order signed on January 21, 2009, reversed a 100-year global warming trend.

So, come October or November 2009, the IPCC will pronounce global warming has stopped, and warn world governments not to rescind the draconian laws that caused this wonderful piece of happy horseshit to drop from the throne of Zeus, aka Obama.

Since the beginning, the goal of the global warming alarmists was to expand the role of government and to limit personal liberty. Global warming is just a convenient tool for advancing socialism, and Barack Obama is the first openly socialist president in the history of the Untied States--he will comply with the Central Committee's orders. 

(Whatever the scientific consensus on global warming might be, the fact is that [no positive correlation](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2008/01/25/warming-trend-pdo-and-solar-correlate-better-than-co2/) exists between increasing levels of atmospheric CO2 and temperature. People like Al Gore make the logical error _post hoc ergo propter hoc_. It's also physically impossible for CFCs to cause the [Ozone hole](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2008/11/09/this-years-antarctic-ozone-hole-is-5th-biggest/#more-4067), but that didn't stop "scientist" from claiming the opposite, nor did that fact stop the wackos from claiming credit for shrinking the the ozone hole over the northern hemisphere despite continued increases in CFC releases.)
