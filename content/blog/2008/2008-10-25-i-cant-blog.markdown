I don't have the heart. It's too depressing. The news is that Obama will win in a landslide because Americans have given up on themselves. They want Obama to:

 

    * Outlaw personal retirement savings, [seize all 401k assets](https://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2008/10/it-has-begun-dem-leaders-call-for-25.html), and create new, bigger version of Social Security** Reduce the military by [at least 25 percent](https://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2008/10/it-has-begun-dem-leaders-call-for-25.html), surrendering Afghanistan and Iraq while leaving Eastern Europe and Israel to fend for themselves** Raise taxes on everyone who's not them** Pass draconian Global Warming laws because the people are too stupid to figure out that man-made global warming is a lie   

The list goes on. Basically, the supposedly middle- to upper-middle-class people who live in my neighborhood are sick of the burden of living and believe socialism will relieve them of all the burdens of adulthood.

 

It will.

 

And it will take all the pleasures of freedom with it.

 

My recommendation: Watch Braveheart tonight with your kids. Prepare them for the sacrifices that will be required if Obama wins and we ever decide to get our freedom back.

 

As [Thomas Sowell](https://townhall.com/columnists/ThomasSowell/2006/08/22/point_of_no_return) and [Mark Steyn](https://article.nationalreview.com/?q=Nzk5MWY5YjU0MDI0ODFkYTZjMDQ2MjlhZDM0MjAwNTA=) point out, an election won't undo the socialist wrought by Democrats: it will take war.

 

Sign me up.
