How this hell did this Investors.com report not make [the Top Story](https://www.investors.com/editorial/editorialcontent.asp?secid=1501&status=article&id=289786626246641)?  (h/t [William Teach](https://www.rightwingnews.com/mt331/2008/03/grey_lady_is_just_wondering_ab.php) and [Roger Kimball](https://pajamasmedia.com/xpress/rogerkimball/2008/03/08/why_is_john_mccains_non_affair.php))

Barack Obama, it seems, sent a delegation meet with FARC leaders in February.  According to letters found on the hard drive of the room-temperature terrorist, Raul Reyes, Obama's people have taken sides with FARC against Columbia's Uribe.


> In a Feb. 28 letter, FARC chieftain Raul Reyes cheerily reported to his inner circle that he met "two gringos" who assured him "the new president of their country will be Obama and that they are interested in your compatriots. Obama will not support 'Plan Colombia' nor will he sign the TLC (Free Trade Agreement)."

Aside from some interesting possibilities about who these "gringos" are - a congressional delegation did visit Ecuador and an international leftist "congress" was held in Quito around this time - the real question is why anyone secretly consorting with FARC would be able to speak for presidential candidate Obama.


Who, indeed?  On the heels of the Canadian-NAFTA secret meetings, we can discern a pattern here.  Obama and his [apparatchiki ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparatchik)are conducting a shadow foreign policy  that appears aimed at (a) damaging the official White House policy and (b) creating strong ties to enemies of freedom. 

Perhaps the FBI needs to look more closely as Senator Obama's ties. 

UPDATE:  You gotta love this paragraph from [roguejew](https://roguejew.wordpress.com/2008/03/06/south-american-terrorists-farc-love-barack-hussein-obama/):


> You've got to hand it to the terrorists. Their analysis of Obama is right on. He's against free trade and he's open to having tea and crumpets with nations that support terrrorism.


Precisely.
