Marxist rebel leader Barack Obama has called a general strike among the proletariat on November 4--election day.  (From [Fox News](https://elections.foxnews.com/2008/10/28/obamas-election-day-rekindle-debate-national-holiday/))


> Obama has been encouraging voters to go to the polls for early voting. The Democratic nominee . . . released a new 30-second spot on his Web site urging voters to "talk to your boss" or professor and then take the day off from work or school to volunteer for his campaign on Election Day.


Obama's Marxist ties go back to his college days where he sought out racial radicals and Marxists.  In one his many autobiographies, Obama wrote:


> I chose my friends carefully.  The more politically active black students. The foreign students. The Chicanos. The Marxist professors and structural feminists.


In this, at least, he tells the truth.  Among his friends:



	  * [William Ayers--](https://www.usnews.com/blogs/barone/2008/8/22/obama-needs-to-explain-his-ties-to-william-ayers.html)Co-Founder of the Marxist-anarchist group [The Weather Underground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_Underground_Organization).  Ayers, who launched Obama's political career, still preaches Marxism at University of Chicago.  Ayers and Obama first met when Obama a was student at Columbia University in New York in the early 1980s.
	  * Tony Rezko--convicted felon and real estate partner of Obama's. 
	  * [Rev. Jeremiah Wright](https://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YTQ0YjhlOGVhYjQ0OWRhZjI2MmM4NTQ4NGM5Mjg0MzU=)--anti-Semitic, anti-American, anti-white pastor of the church Obama and Ayers conspired to funnel hundreds of thousands of dollars earmarked for education when the two served on the boards of the Wood Foundation. 
	  * [Rashid Khalidi](https://elections.foxnews.com/2008/10/28/la-times-refuses-release-tape-obama-praising-controversial-activist/)--Palestinian terrorism supporter and anti-Semite who is one of Obama's closest friends.  Even the [LA Times](https://www.latimes.com/news/la-na-obamamideast10apr10,0,1488910.story) admits Obama is one of Palestian terrorism's best friends.

If elected, Obama would be America's first Marxist president.  With his party in control of both houses of Congress, Obama would be in a position to abolish the Constitution and its intentional limits on the powers of government, replacing it with a "redistributive justice" document that gives the government unlimited authority to seize property and redistribute private property. 

A vote for Obama is a repudiation of self-government.
