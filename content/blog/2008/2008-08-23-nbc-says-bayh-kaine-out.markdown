[MSNBC ](https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26336195/)says sources confirmed that both Evan Bayh and Tim Kaine have been given the "thanks, but no thanks" call from [Obama](https://hennessysview.com/2008/08/18/the-absolution-candidate/).

That leaves Joe Biden and dark horses.

Assume it's [Biden](https://wizbangblog.com/content/2008/08/22/more-speculation-on-obamas-vp.php).

The curious thing is the [Obama/Bayh '08 stickers ](https://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2008/08/obama-bayh-liveblogging-from-gill.html)being produced in Kansas City.  Of course, that could be misdirection.  Gill Studios, the outfit producing the stickers, is on the Obama payroll, along with [ACORN and other criminal organizations](https://michellemalkin.com/2008/08/22/acorn-watch-pt-ii-obama-hid-800000-payment-to-acorn-through-citizen-services-inc/), according to Michelle Malkin.
