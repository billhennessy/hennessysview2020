Today is the Wyoming Republican caucus.  Unfortunately, I know no one from Wyoming, though I do have a few business acquaintances from Montana.   My cousin Bob lived in Wyoming for a few years after college, from whence he hitch-hiked to St. Louis for the annual Hennessy St. Patrick's Day party at Uncle Jim's. 

Since I have no one to appeal to directly, I hope some Wyomingites stumple upon my humble blog and decide to wander to their county convention and cast a vote for conservatism in the person of Fred Thompson.

[Michelle Malkin ](https://michellemalkin.com/2008/01/05/what-about-wyoming/)posts some interesting facts and projections about the Wyoming event.  She points to [Jim Geraghty's ](https://campaignspot.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MWMyMjVhYjE0ZDM0MWUzNzY2NWY5ZjUzMmUwNzAxMGI=)prediciton of 2 delegates for Thompson.  Perhaps the good folks to my west will upset that prediction with 3 or 4 for Fred.  Maybe then the MSM and FoxNews will prove me right by giving Fred some publicity for his surge in Iowa.

Sean Hackbarth, posting on Fred08.com, provides some [logistics for any Fredheads ](https://fredfile.fred08.com/blog/2008/help-fred-thompson-in-wyoming/)who'd like help in Wyoming today. 

Also, the Red Truck is back on [Fred's homepage](https://www.fred08.com/).  The post-Christmas Blog Burst for Iowa helped drive the surge there.  Half a million for South Carolina will turn Fred's 3rd place finish into a Win for the one viable, solid, Reagan conservative in the GOP field.    You[ can donate here](https://www.fred08.com/contribute.aspx?RefererID=4987be96-4295-4dda-be05-236f28ab766f), and tell your friends.  Anyone who supports Fred but hasn't coughed up some cash, please do so now.  South Carolina could be the [make-or-break ](https://tennesseansforthompson.blogspot.com/2008/01/south-carolina-is-thompsons-opportunity.html)state for Fred.

Finally, [Newsbusters ](https://newsbusters.org/blogs/bill-hobbs/2008/01/04/politico-continues-hatchet-job-fred-thompson)has more on [Politico's all-out warfare ](https://hennessysview.com/2008/01/04/politico-waste-of-zeroes-and-ones/)against Fred Thompson.  Give Bill Hobbs high marks for using the right word to describe Politico "reporters":


> Politico reporter Roger Simon recently **lied **in The Politico about an incident at an Iowa fire hall involving Sen. Thompson and a fire helmet - an "error" that The Politico has never corrected even though video of the event clearly exposed the error.


That's right.  Politico is a pack of liars.  They should work for [MSNBC](https://michellemalkin.com/2008/01/02/ex-nbc-journalist-explains-why-nbc-news-sucks/). 

Another way to help is to make phone calls for Fred.  On Fred08.com, you can[ call South Carolina, Florida, or New Hampshire ](https://www.fred08.com/grassroots/start.aspx)Republicans to remind them to vote for Fred.  It's easy and a great chance to help conservatism.  I just spent an hour with people in South Carolina.
