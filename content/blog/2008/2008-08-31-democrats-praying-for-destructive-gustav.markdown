**UPDATE** Don Fowler, former DNC Chairman, apologizes for praying that Gustav destroys New Orleans. The story is buried deep in the bowels of [ABCNews.com](https://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2008/08/ex-dem-chair-ap.html)   


> "If this offended anybody, I personally apologize," Fowler told ABC News. "It was a mistake, and it was a satirical statement made in jest. And one that I clearly don't believe."

**End Update**

Chris Dodd can barely contain himself. Shaving is almost impossible because he can't subdue his smile long enough to get around his lips. But he struggles through, the old trooper.

Dodd's happiness comes from the Caribbean where Hurricane Gustav threatens to swamp New Orleans. For the Democrats, this the game changer. They have armies of talk show guests ready to blame Katrina and Gustav on John McCain. They are thrilled that the RNC won't get a convention.

While John McCain and Sarah Palin speak of "Country First," Barack Obama nods, and whispers, "right after a hurricane gives me a bounce in the polls."

Michael Moore: "Gustav is proof that there is a God in Heaven."

Don Fowler, former chairman of the DNC and a Democrat Congressman from South Carolina giggle and laugh because of Gustav (via [Michelle Malkin](https://michellemalkin.com/2008/08/31/while-louisiana-prepares-for-hurricane-gustav-dems-gloat-and-guffaw/)):

> The hurricane’s going to hit New Orleans about the time they start. [Chuckle] The timing is — at least it appears now that it’ll be there Monday. That just demonstrates that God’s on our side. [Laughter] … Everything’s cool. [[Link to Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrBus8ORR78)]

Republicans may occasionally be guilty of indifference to problems that don't directly affect them. We all lack appropriate compassion from time to time. But John McCain and Sarah Palin are not praying for death and disaster in order to benefit politically. That's solely the territory of Democrats--evil bastards that they are.

Were this Newt Gingrich and Fred Thompson giggling about 9/11 and its Republic vote windfall, the video would open every news program on television and ready. The transcript would be the NY Times front page headline. But it's okay, in America, for Democrats to hope and pray that Louisianans and Mississippians lose income, property, and life so long as it helps Obama.

"Country First." Obama can mouth these words all he wants, but they mean nothing coming from him. His party is cheering against New Orleans just as they cheered against our troops in Iraq. These people hate America and hope to see it punished. These people have a psychological pathology more frightening and dangerous than untreated paranoid schizophrenia.

Delenda Obama est.
