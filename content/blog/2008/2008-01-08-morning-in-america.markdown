Many of you don't remember 1984.  I was a junior in college, campaigning for Reagan, on campus and off.  For those of you who weren't around then, I can tell that even gray, rainy days were brighter than than sunniest June sky had been in 1979.

Nothing expresses the change in America better than this classic.  Brought to you by the Republicans.
