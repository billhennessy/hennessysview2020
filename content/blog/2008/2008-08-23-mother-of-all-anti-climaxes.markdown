CNN's John King has confirmed from two unnamed sources that ultra-liberal Joe Biden is Obama's veep choice. 

When you want to bury a story, you release it on Friday after 3:00 p.m.  So, why did the Obama campaign release the news on the worst night in the news cycle?

Because Biden was the party's choice, not Obama's.

Obama wanted a young candidate, a liberal, who would make Obama look stronger, older, weightier.  His drop in the polls gave the party insiders more influence.  They wanted Biden to give the ticket strength.

Obama got to pick the time, and he picked the midnight hour on a Friday.

Obama is a disaster for the Democrats, and Biden won't help.  News will trickle out over the next week about the inside politics that forced Obama to take Biden.  Obama's bump will turn into a drop before the GOP convention is done.

It's looking more and more likely that John McCain will be the next President of the United States.

**Update:  Obama's mishandling of the VP announcement will go down as an interesting side note in the history of presidential elections.  [Patrick Ruffini ](by stringing everyone along, Obama's camp waited too long. They didn't coordinate the logistics of securing the nominee with the actual notification process. Though I'd love to think that the Secret Service would move in in response to a text, in the real world that probably isn't going to happen yet.)lays out the series of failures that resulted in, not only anti-climax, but actual dishonesty and inconvenience.  Obama promised to make you the "first to know" by sending him your cell phone number.  Instead, people watching CNN, FoxNews, ABC, or any news web site were first to know--four hours before text messages woke up potential voters at 3:00 a.m.  (It's not nice to wake up voters in the wee hours of a Saturday morning, but that's lost on a man who never worked a day in his life.)

Also, Ed Morrissey [recognizes the lameness ](https://hotair.com/archives/2008/08/23/in-the-dead-of-night-obama-announces-vp-choice/)of the announcement, the demontration of immaturity and ignorance rampant in the process.  He's right.
