](https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/israel-flag.jpg) The most important fact in this story: retaliation.

 

Israel attacked [dozens of terrorist targets](https://apnews.myway.com/article/20081227/D95B2TC00.html) in Gaza today, killing at least 145.

 

The Arab world (yawn) [reacted predictably](https://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1230111718169&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull), condemning Israel (yawn) and staging street protests (yawn). I'm sure many a rifle was fired into the air. 

 

The left--and I suspect Barack Obama is included--will decry Israel's self-defense. They will call for Israel to show restraint. They will call on Israel to take another body blow.

 

They won't mention the 100s of rockets fired into southern Israel on Christmas Eve. They won't mention that the Palestinians went out of their way to ruin Christmas pilgrimages for tens of thousands of Christians. They won't mention that the Palestinians started this.
