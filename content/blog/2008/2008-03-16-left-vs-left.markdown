Someone wise once said that when your opponent is hell-bent on destroying himself, let him.

The Left's most popular blog [**Daily Kos **](https://www.dailykos.com/story/2008/3/14/20827/4727/132/476843)is imploding faster than [**the Obama campaign**](https://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2008/03/more-hate-speech-new-video-of-obamas.html).*

Recent Rasmussen and Gallop polls support GP's anecdotal evidence. In the national tracking polls released yesterday and today, McCain would be either Clinton or Obama by at least 5 percentage points if the election were held today. That's an enormous slide for the Democrats. Just a week ago, either Hillary or Barack would have beaten McCain by 2 percentage point margin.

 

Part of this shift is just statistical noise. But part reflects, I think, the public's distaste for the party of Jim Crow. If, somehow, Hillary gets the nomination, the violent rhetoric of Rev. Wright will spill over into the streets.
