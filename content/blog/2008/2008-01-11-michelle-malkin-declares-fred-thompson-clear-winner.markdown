I could not watch the South Carolin GOP debate tonight, but I am ecstatic.  Ron Paul  made an ass of himself, but [Michelle Malkin](https://michellemalkin.com/2008/01/10/fred-thompson-late/) who, like me, seems to fret over Fred's performances sometimes, has no doubt [Fred won.](https://michellemalkin.com/2008/01/10/the-south-carolina-gop-debate/)

From the clip I blogged below, I have to give points to Romney for slamming Ron Paul.   As a war hero, John McCain had every right to across the stage and belt that phony, lying, racist scum.  But I'm glad he didn't--that would have sealed McCain's nomination and election.

****UPDATE*****

WHOA!  I just watched the clips of the debate on [Fred08.com](https://fredfile.fred08.com/blog/2008/video-great-debate-moments/).  Whoa! and again, whoa!   Our man was on fire tonight, and he flew past his $540,000 goal.

Congratulations, Fred.
