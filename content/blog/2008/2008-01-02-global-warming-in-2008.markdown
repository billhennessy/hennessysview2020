](https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/gtemps2.gif)Despite the Nobel committee's best efforts, 2007 turned out to be a bad year for global warming hoaxters.  Global, 2007 was the [coolest since 2001](https://www.longrangeweather.com/Long-Range-Weather-Trends.htm).  The 387 category 5 hurricanes predicted to strike Miami in  at the rate of 3 per day until every (non-white) man, woman, and child was dead never happened.

In a glorious NYT op-ed, John Tierney lambastes the leftist, the global warming fearmongers, the idiot soccer moms who accept the non-science of greenhouse effect as readily as they accept their mediocre offspring are genetically superior any other nineteen human beings put together.



> Today’s interpreters of the weather are what social scientists call availability entrepreneurs: the activists, journalists and publicity-savvy scientists who selectively monitor the globe looking for newsworthy evidence of a new form of sinfulness, burning fossil fuels.
A year ago, British meteorologists made headlines predicting that the buildup of greenhouse gases would help make 2007 the hottest year on record. At year’s end, even though the British scientists reported the global temperature average was not a new record — it was actually lower than any year since 2001 — the BBC confidently proclaimed, “2007 Data Confirms Warming Trend.”

When the Arctic sea ice last year hit the lowest level ever recorded by satellites, it was big news and heralded as a sign that the whole planet was warming. When the Antarctic sea ice last year reached the highest level ever recorded by satellites, it was pretty much ignored. A large part of Antarctica has been cooling recently, but most coverage of that continent has focused on one small part that has warmed [[source](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/01/science/01tier.html?ex=1356930000&en=852a381c6d1a9297&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss)].


I expect activists who earn degrees to continue their activism.  It's the layman, adequately educated through our tax system, loans, and generous parents, that I can't stand.  It's the smug forty-year-old who knows how to amass a million dollars in retirement savings but refuses to subject global warming theories to his own scientific inquiry.  It's this ordinary American idiot that gives the global warming hoax its legs.

The worst news of all for the 2008 is the election, because these idiots I write of vote.
