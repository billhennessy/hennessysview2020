Apparently Beth ([MY Vast Right Wing Conspiracy](https://bamapachyderm.com/archives/2008/01/20/whos-crazier-tom-cruise-or-britney-spears/)) overheard a conversation between my wife and me at dinner last night. We were talking about Kiefer Sutherland's release from jail, which led us to how whacked Britney Spears is, to which my wife added, "[Tom Cruise is even worse](https://defamer.com/344987/the-tom-cruise-indoctrination-video-scientologists-dont-want-you-to-see)."
