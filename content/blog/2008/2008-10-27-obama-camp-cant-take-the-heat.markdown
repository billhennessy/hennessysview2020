Barack Obama's campaign blacklisted WFTV, a Florida television station, because its anchoress, Barbara West, refused to ask Joe Biden the questions prepared and approved by the Obama campaign.

 

Barabara West asked Biden hard hitting questions--almost as hard-hitting as questions routinely fired at GOP Vice President candidate Sarah Palin. At one point, Biden said, "[I don't know who's writing your questions](https://elections.foxnews.com/2008/10/25/obama-campaign-cuts-interviews-florida-tv-station/)," showing his surprised that West was making up questions rather than reading the ones written for her by the Obama campaign.

 

Expect Barbara West to be [robbed and beaten](https://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/10/25/tv.anchor.attack/?iref=mpstoryview) after Comrade Obama seizes power. The One doesn't put up with insubordination by the formerly free press.
