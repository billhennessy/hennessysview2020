On the night that the President of the United States described America's current economic condition in terms reminiscent of the Great Depression comes word from [Ben Smith](https://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0908/Johnson_to_lead_Obama_briefing.html) at Politico that one of the chief architects of the next depression, Countrywide and Fannie Mae thief James Johnson, is advising Barack Obama on how to proceed on this crisis.

 

Smith quotes former Senator Tom Daschle:

 

Jim Johnson and I have scheduled another informal breakfast discussion and update on the campaign early next month.

 

Taking the advice of a disgraced national criminal like Johnson, and doing so with no shame or attempt at concealment, demonstrates the maddening hubris of Barack Obama. It's one of the many factors that make the man truly hate-able. More hate-able than Bill Clinton ever was.

 

There's no doubt as to why Obama must work with Johnson: Johnson, Franklin Raines, and their minions at Fannie Mae and Countrywide have given money to Obama at historic rates. Few politicians of any party have received so much cash in so short a time from so small a cadre as Obama's received from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac personnel: $42,000 a year since Obama's entered the Senate. By contrast, the second-place bribe-taker, Hillary Clinton, has received $10,000 a year.
