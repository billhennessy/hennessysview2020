In an [NPR interview in 2001](https://hotair.com/archives/2008/10/27/smells-like-socialist-spirit/), Barack Obama admitted that he despises the US Constitution because it limits government. He stated that the Warren Court did not go far enough in redistributing wealth.  In essence, the tape confirmed conservatives' worst suspicions of Obama's motives. 

Last night, [I blogged on light side](https://hennessysview.com/2008/10/26/the-message/), asking those who support Obama whether or not they're ready to change the US form of government.  I tried to make the case that Barack Obama's long associations with admitted communists and terrorists, combined with expected Democrat control of both houses of Congress, placed at risk the idea of self-government, limited in its powers by a Constitution written by the People and enumerating those particular powers that we cede to the government.

Today, we learned that Barack Hussein Obama holds the Constitution in extreme contempt.

In Obama's own words, only 7 years ago:

the Supreme Court never ventured into the issues of redistribution of wealth, and of more basic issues such as political and economic justice in society.

Obama would sever all ties to the Constitution:


> It didn’t break free from the essential constraints that were placed by the founding fathers in the Constitution . . .

The Constitution reflected fundamental flaw of this country that continues to this day.


A government unrestrained is Obama's goal:


> I think there was a tendency to lose track of the political and community organizing and activities on the ground that are able to put together the actual coalition of powers through which you bring about redistributive change.


The Obama campaign lied, today, denying the tape, claiming it was invented by a conspiracy among Fox News, [Matt Drudge,](https://www.drudgereport.com/) and John McCain.  Here is [false statement from Obama spokesman Bill Burton](https://elections.foxnews.com/2008/10/27/radio-interview-obama-laments-lack-supreme-court-ruling-redistributing-wealth/):


> This is a fake news controversy drummed up by the all too common alliance of FOX News, the Drudge Report and John McCain, who apparently decided to close out his campaign with the same false, desperate attacks that have failed for months.


Amazingly, ALL of the mainstream media refused to carry any aspect of the story.  With the way the MSM--The New York Times, CNN, MSNBC, ABC, LA Times, Washington Post--have repeatedly covered up Obama's communist ties and sentiments, I would not be surprised if Obama has murdered, raped, and imported cocaine.  We would never know.

Those of you who still support Obama must accept the title "Fellow Traveler." 

*UPDATE*  Red Alerts gives McCain t[he money line of the campaign](https://www.red-alerts.com/country-first/mccain-obamas-a-goddamn-communist/).  Maybe on Friday.
