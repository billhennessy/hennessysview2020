Live blog of the most anticipated convention speech in our lifetimes.

[https://www.coveritlive.com/index2.php/option=com_altcaster/task=viewaltcast/altcast_code=5af59d4052/height=550/width=470](https://www.coveritlive.com/index2.php/option=com_altcaster/task=viewaltcast/altcast_code=5af59d4052/height=550/width=470)

Anderson Cooper, CNN:  "The excitement here is palpable."
Shep Smith, Fox:  "I have never been so excited about speech in my life.  I can't wait."
Chris Wallace, Fox: "Oh, this is big, I'm excited, and that doesn't happen at conventions very often."

I feel like I did at 4:30 p.m. on Super Bowl Sunday in 2000:  one hour before the Rammies kicked off against the Titans.  

The left expect her, apparently, to throw up on the podium, rip off her dress, and do a pole dance with a bear skin rug.  Talk about lowering expectations.

For my part, I think she needs to stay away from direct attacks on the media.  Side glances at the left in general and Barack Obama in particular.  

She does not have to hit a "home run."  Expectations are lower than whale waste.  She has to simply be competent, human, ruggedly feminine, and likable.  

My fingers are crossed.
