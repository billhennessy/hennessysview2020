Sorry, folks.  I'm paying attention to the world in between client meetings.  I have my most significant client in town.

I am heartbroken that Fred Thompson ended his race.   I am discouraged that he _had_ to end it. The only Reagan conservative--well, Reagan-style conservative--in the race is gone.  My best to Fred and his family.

That leaves us with McCain (moderate) and Romney (smarmy).

And Obama (Jimmy Carter).

I'll blog more tomorrow, but Carter's presidency gave us Reagan.
