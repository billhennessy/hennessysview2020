> Spokesman Tommy Vietor emails:

"Rev. Wright is no longer serving on the African American Religious Leadership Committee."


This is a reversal of the campaign's official line, according to [Gateway Pundit](https://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2008/03/obama-defends-his-racist-pastor-says-he.html). I guess Barack's [not black enough](https://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-op-chude-sokei18feb18,0,7298828.story?coll=la-opinion-center) for Rev. Wright.
