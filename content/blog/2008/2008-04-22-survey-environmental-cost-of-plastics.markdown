Please take a quick, [10-question survey](https://hennessysview.plastics.sgizmo.com) on the environmental cost of plastics.

This survey is for an environmental science class, and will help me get a good grade. Please forward this link to anyone you know might want to help me with this survey. I need at least 25 responses, but the more, the merrier.

Thanks, in advance, for your help.
