On Friday, the New York Times refused to publish an op-ed piece by Republican nominee John McCain ([FoxNews.com](https://elections.foxnews.com/2008/07/21/mccain-campaign-says-new-york-times-blocked-op-ed-response-to-obama/)).  This might be the first time in American history that a newspaper turned down a column by a presidential candidate from a major party.  According to Jonathan Martin of [Politico](https://www.politico.com/blogs/jonathanmartin/0708/NYT_wanted_timetables_in_McCain_oped.html?showall), the Times demanded that McCain include "timetables" for withdrawal if he wants NYT inches. 

This also demonstrates why liberalism is incompatible with democracy.  Liberals are totalitarians by nature.  They seek to limit others rights in order to maximize their own interests.  David Shipley, the former Clinton hack who rejected McCain's piece, said it didn't meet the paper's pathetic standards. Hey Shitley:  I just flushed a piece of paper that exceeds the New York Times' standards.

What do you want to bet that this Shitley character donated $2K to Obama and has an unhealthy interest in young boys at the club swimming pool?

I was lukewarm toward McCain until this week. Between the 24/7 ass-kissing by the MSM of Obama's subversive trip to countries whose names he can't spell and the NYT finally pulling the last straw on reason, I've had it.  Better dead than living in Obamanation.  (See Gateway Pundit for[ Obama's latest anti-American ](https://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2008/07/pathetic-obama-says-he-would-still.html)crap, as that communist f*ck credited the goddam Sunnis, not the Surge, for progress in Iraq.) America and the world would be better off if Obama never made it back from Sandland.

Michelle Malkin [thinks it funny](https://michellemalkin.com/2008/07/21/maverick-discovers-that-msm-libs-are-not-his-friends/) that the very psycho libs McCain sucks up to now ask him to bend over for their fellow.  I find it frightening.  The left will do anything--anything at all--to win this election, and we should be prepared to do anything to stop them.

Think I'm imagining this liberal bias?  According to [Rasmussen ](https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/election_20082/2008_presidential_election/belief_growing_that_reporters_are_trying_to_help_obama_win)(h/t Malkin):


> The latest Rasmussen Reports telephone survey, taken just before the new controversy involving the Times erupted, found that 49% of voters believe most reporters will try to help the Democrat with their coverage


In other words, half the country realizes that the David Shipley will lie, cheat, steal, and kill to win this thing for his boy.

The poll reveals how tolerant Democrats are of cheating:


> a plurality of Democrats—37%-- say most reporters try to offer unbiased coverage of the campaign.


Lying bastards.  May they all rot in hell.

But there's more from Rasmussen.  People believe that the media are trying to kill the American economy, put you out of your house, and sell more great American companies to Eurotrash idiots like Carlos Brito. 


> A [separate survey released this morning](https://hennessysview.com/public_content/business/general_business/50_say_media_makes_economy_look_worse_than_it_really_is) also found that 50% of voters believe most reporters want to make the economy seem worse than it is.


Duh.  They also invented human-influenced global warming.  They're evil.  Not just different the way Poodles are different from Labradors, but evil.  Mean.  Out to hurt people for their own pleasure.  David Shipley would have been highly decorated at Auschwitz.  He'd have done a fine job of reviewing the Jews' appeals for release.  "Nein, and it's time for your shower."

I'm disgusted.
