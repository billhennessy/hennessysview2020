I have to admit, I paid absolutely no attention to recent polls in Nevada. South Carolina is where the action is, where my attention has been, and where my head and heart lie. South Carolina is where Fred Thompson, the conservative candidate for President, makes his stand.

South Carolinians--vote! vote! VOTE FOR [FRED](https://www.fred08.com)!
