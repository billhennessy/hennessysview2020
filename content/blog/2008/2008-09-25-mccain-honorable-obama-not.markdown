John McCain took an enormous risk today by [suspending his campaign](https://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2008/09/mccain-pulls-out-of-debate-due-to.html) for President in order to do his job as a Senator, party leader, and statesman. He returned to Washington to help prevent an economic depression brought about by Obama's financial advisors, among others.

 

Barack Obama ratcheted up the heat on McCain and Bush, blaming them for what his friends have done to America. 

 

[McCain is noble and honorable](https://wizbangblog.com/content/2008/09/24/breaking-john-mccain-suspends-campaign-to-go-to-washington-for-bailout-debate.php); Obama is a putz.

 

[Obama said today](https://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSTRE48N8AV20080924) this is the greatest financial crisis since the Great Depression, yet it doesn't rise to a level requiring him to actually do his job.

 

Anyone who votes for Obama after all this deserves the cesspool of a country that the commie from South Chicago hopes to deliver. But what about the rest of us? Where do we go to get our liberty back?
