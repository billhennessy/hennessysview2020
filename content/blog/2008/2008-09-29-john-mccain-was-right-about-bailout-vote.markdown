Barry "Himmler" Obama mocked John McCain for claiming that the administration's $700 billion bailout plan lacked the votes to pass.  At the White House meeting last Thursday, Obama was insulting and abusive to everyone in the room.  The man who didn't know that the inauguration is in January and not November appeared not to know that he wasn't President.

Turns out McCain was right.  Even after making progress in Washington last week and over the weekend, the bailout package still lacked a majority in the House.  

Forty percent of Democrats voted against the bill, along with two-thirds of Republicans.  Republicans who voted against the bill cited constituent opposition and Nancy Pelosi's post-agreement bitch-session from her pulpit in the House Chamber. 

Kudos to the GOP Representatives who had the courage to vote against the bill.
