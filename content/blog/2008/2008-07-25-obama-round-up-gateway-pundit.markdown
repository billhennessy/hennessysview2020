The best Obama round-up is on [The Gateway Pundit](https://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/). 

Obama's so anti-American and so, well, stupid, that it's difficult for me to keep up with his antics.  It's nice to know that someone has it covered.

By the way, you cannot vote for Obama and call yourself and American patriot.  Unless you're really dumb.
