<strike>Fox New just called Ohio for Obama, meaning McCain is mathematically eliminated. </strike>

 

UPDATE: Looks like Obama has won [Florida](https://abcnews.go.com/politics/elections/?category=Florida). Michigan and Minnesota have gone communist, joining Wisconsin.

 

UPDATE: Why is Major Garrett interviewing Adolf Hitler?

 

UPDATE 8:05: Senate Calls (that matter) John Barrasso (R) wins special election in Wyoming; Mike Enzi (R) wins re-election; Republican Pat Robert wins re-election in Kansas; Tim Johnson (D) wins re-election in SD; Dems pick up Pete Dominici's Senate seat in New Mexico (Dems +4); Jeff Session retains his seat, as does Thad Cochran (both Republicans); the special election for Senate in Mississippi too close to call, but the Republican leads.

 

UPDATE 8:16: [Allapundit](https://hotair.com/archives/2008/11/04/round-three-co-nm/) is swinging the towel above his head in preparation for throwing. 

 

Good night, comrades.
