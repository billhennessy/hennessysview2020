She thoroughly and unquestionably denounced everything that's come from Washington Post, New York Times, [US magazine](https://michellemalkin.com/2008/09/02/pds-alert-us-magazines-partisan-hit-job/), and [Barney Frank](https://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2008/09/leading-democrat-sarah-palins-family.html)
