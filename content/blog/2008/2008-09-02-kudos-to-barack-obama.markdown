Asked about Bristol Palin's pregnancy, Barack Obama firmly stated that children of candidates are "off limits," and that anyone in his campaign discussing the matter "will be fired."

Outstanding.  I watched and heard the interview, and I have no doubt he meant what he said.  His vigor was sincere.

As someone who villifies Obama regularly, I owe it to the man when he comes through.  This time he did.

I hope his minions listen.
