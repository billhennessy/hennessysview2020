The Federal Reserve Board's Open Market Committee released the [minutes](https://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/fomcminutes20081029.pdf) of its October 28-29 meeting, today, in which some members raise the specter of economic depression extending more than 4 consecutive quarters. The report calls the present financial mess the worst in more than half a century, carefully avoiding direct references to [the Great Depression](https://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D94I6CF00&show_article=1).

 

**Stocks Tank**

 

[Wall Street responded](https://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D94I822O0&show_article=1) with [427 point (5.16 percent) collapse](https://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/fomcminutes20081029.pdf), with Citigroup leading financial stocks to a 10 percent crash. Citigroup lost 25 percent of its value today.

 

Most economists consider a [depression](https://useconomy.about.com/od/grossdomesticproduct/f/Depression.htm) more than 1 year of negative GDP growth. The last depression in the United States was the Great Depression of 1930 through 1942. Only increased wartime production ended that economic chaos.

 

**Fed Has Been Overly Optimistic**

 

The [Wall Street Journal](https://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/fomcminutes20081029.pdf) (subscription required) notes that in recent meetings, the Fed has underestimated the economy's weaknesses, which could mean unemployment, bankruptcies, and negative growth could get far worse than today's report suggests:

 

    * The Fed downgraded its previous expectations for GDP growth for 2008 after significantly over-estimating 2008 growth in its August meeting** The Fed downgraded its 2009 growth estimate from greater than 2 percent to -0.2 to 1 percent** The Fed raised it unemployment forecast to 6.5 percent, even though unemployment is already above 6.5. In August, they predicted 5.5 to 5.7 percent unemployment   

**Blog Reactions**

 

[Allahpundit has a poll](https://hotair.com/archives/2008/11/19/great-news-dow-crumbles-again-closes-below-8000/) asking where the market will stand on 1/1/2009. I picked 6,000-6,999. I expect the DJIA to reach and hold 6,900 by Demember through mid-2010, trading in a range of +400 to -200 points.

 

[Gateway Pundit](https://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2008/11/obama-stock-market-nosedive-continues.html) notes that this is the largest post-election sell-off in history.
