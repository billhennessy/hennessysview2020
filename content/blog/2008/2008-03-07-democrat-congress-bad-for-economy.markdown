We are in for the worst economy since . . . the last time Democrats controlled Congress.

I compared three economic numbers from the January 1994, when Democrats lost control of Congress and January 2007, when they took Congress back.  Then looked at what's happened since.  It isn't pretty

You can't blame anyone for these numbers except the Democrats.  From the time he took office until the time Newt took the gavel, Clinton's economy was flat.  Al Gore said, in 1993, that 2 percent GDP growth was all that Americans could expect.  In that same year, Clinton said that the federal budget would remain unbalanced for at least 20 years.

Gore and Clinton were wrong, of course, because the American people did something about it: the elected Republicans.
