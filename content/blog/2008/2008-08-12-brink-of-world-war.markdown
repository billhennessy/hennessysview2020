Am I the only person who sees that we are on the [brink of world war](https://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,401243,00.html) thanks to those Russian sonsofbitches?


> **Russian forces swept across Georgia on Monday, capturing the town of Gori and moving to within 35 miles of the capital city Tbilisi, FOX News confirmed.**


This is very serious stuff.  Russia's expansionist intentions are as obvious as they were in the [Prague Spring ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague_Spring)and the [Hungarian Revolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Revolution_of_1956).

The [blogosphere ](https://hotair.com/archives/2008/08/11/bush-russians-looking-to-depose-georgian-government/)seems to buy the idea that the world will respond only diplomatically.  I don't--not unless Russia backs down fast and far.

Putin is clearly on a mission to restore the Soviet Union.  He has poisoned opponents, threatened neighbors, armed Iran, and has now wantonly and without provocation invaded a sovereign nation for the purpose of deposing a freely elected government to be replaced with a Warsaw Pact puppet.

Putin's second goal seems to be [oil prices](https://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2008/news/oil/).  World crude prices have plummeted in recent weeks, boosting the dollar and vindicating Bush's oil strategy.  Russia quickly attacked a major oil pipeline in Georgia.   Continued conflict will likely push oil prices back up. 

President Bush, [John McCain](https://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/News/PressReleases/612817d8-e377-44df-9ebe-aca0ea95e945.htm), and, even, Barack Obama have verbally unloaded on Russia in terms as strong as Ronald Reagan's invectives against the Soviet Union.  Putin has fired back.  Georgia signed a cease-fire resolution, but [Russian troops march on](https://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/08/11/georgia.russia/index.html).  The UN says at least 2,000 civilians have already been killed, making the civilian death several times greater than at the [peak of the war in Iraq](https://www.icasualties.org/oif/IraqiDeaths.aspx).  If the fighting continues, Russians will kill 12,000 civilians in the first month of war.

I understand that this arose quickly and under the cover of the Olympics, but this is biggest threat to world peace since the Cuban Missile Crisis. 

Pay attention.

UPDATE:  [Gateway Pundit ](https://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/)is on the story in his usual great style.  Also,[ Black Five ](https://www.blackfive.net/main/2008/08/georgia-on-my-m.html)links to several excellent sites closer to the scene.  That's where I learned that [Russia has now split Georgia in half](https://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=19052).  Unfortunately, Russia is hacking [Georgian web sites](https://georgiamfa.blogspot.com/).

ANOTHER UPDATE:  Hello to my new Russian readers.  If you want peace, better depose Putin.  [George F. Will,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/11/AR2008081102156.html?hpid=opinionsbox1) in his brilliant way, paints an ominous picture:


> Asked in 1957 what would determine his government's course, Harold Macmillan, Britain's new prime minister, replied, "Events, dear boy, events." Now, into America's trivializing presidential campaign, a pesky event has intruded -- a European war. Russian tanks, heavy artillery, strategic bombers, ballistic missiles and a naval blockade batter a European nation. We are not past such things after all. The end of history will be postponed, again.


Now, go [read this](https://www.boomantribune.com/story/2008/8/11/113925/867).  Don't argue with me, [just read it.](https://www.boomantribune.com/story/2008/8/11/113925/867)
