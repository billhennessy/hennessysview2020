More bad news about John McCain's selection for Vice President emerged tonight. Sarah Palin was cited for [fishing without a license](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/sep/01/mccain-camps-detailed-review-of-palin-1/).

CNN is sending a team of reporters and producers to Wasilla, Alaska, to cover this emerging scandal.

The citation does not indicate what she was fishing with or for, but the fact that a would-be Vice President of the United States did, with malice aforethought, cast her line into known fishing waters with the intent of extracting--or reasonably expecting to extract--a live fish demonstrates her unfitness for office of any kind.

No wonder the libtard media are so down on Sarah.
