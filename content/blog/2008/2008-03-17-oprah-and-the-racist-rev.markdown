I watched tonight's edition of one my favorite shows, "Extreme Makeover: Home Edition." Following is Oprah's Big Give. 

I was never a huge Oprah Winfrey fan, but learning that she chooses an anti-American racist as her minister poisoned whatever good feelings I might have had for her.

Differences between races because of cultural histories are certain. Oprah and Obama, though, demonstrate, in their allegiance to Reverend Wright, a moral corruption that cannot be papered over with soothing rhetoric or million dollar giveaways. At some point, penance comes due.
