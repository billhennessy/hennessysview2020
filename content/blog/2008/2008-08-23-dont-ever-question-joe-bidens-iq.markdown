His IQ is higher than yours and mine, and he ain't afraid to say so. (H/t [Allahpundit on HotAir.com](https://hotair.com/archives/2008/08/23/flashback-the-obligatory-i-think-i-probably-have-a-much-higher-iq-than-you-do-clip/))

Wow.  Smart, smart man.  Only . . . most colleges don't have an IQ requirement.  George W. Bush has degrees from Yale and Harvard, but his IQ is, like, 28 according to Biden.  I guess whatever schools Biden went to, they give diplomas based on IQ instead of credit hours.  Interesting.
