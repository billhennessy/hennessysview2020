Now you know. You can stop doubting. You have more than hope.

The Obama administration spied on Donald Trump and his campaign and transition teams. **[There is no longer any doubt](https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-03-31/nbc-confirms-obama-administration-officials-saved-trump-russia-probe-docs).**

The questions that remain are:




** Who ordered and authorized the illegal wiretaps?
** Who illegally received and disseminated the intelligence?
** What did Obama know?


It's easy to declare the **Obama Admin guilty** after Evelyn Farkas's admissions on MSNBC. Her admissions indicate:




** Obama admin illegally spied on Trump team
** She urges Obama intelligence officials to disseminate raw intelligence to Congress and the press
** Her motivation was purely political


After admitting to possible felonies, Farkas has tried to erase her admissions. PowerLine describes her as "[going Sergeant Schultz](https://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2017/03/evelyn-farkas-goes-full-sergeant-schultz.php)." But [the deeper you go, the dirty she looks](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/31/white-house-wants-congress-to-dig-deeper-on-snooping-after-obama-official-comments.html).

Adding to Farkas's admission, we know now that [Rep. Devin Nunes](https://www.nationalreview.com/article/446302/devin-nunes-trump-surveillance-riddle-deepens-he-must-not-step-down) knew about the wiretaps as far back as January. His attempts to see the documents were **stonewalled by Obama holdovers** in the intelligence community.

Now, even Democrats have access to those **damning documents** that could send Farkas and many other Obama officials to prison. They can't hide the truth much longer.

Meanwhile, the CIA's case against Trump just turned into the people's case against the CIA. [Wikileaks published the source code ](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/03/wikileaks-cia-uses-computer-code-disguise-hacking-attacks-russian-chinese-video/)the **CIA uses to hack into private servers (like the DNC's)** and leave "fingerprints" of Russian hackers. It now looks to everyone like the whole "Russia did it" narrative was contrived and executed by criminals in the CIA. **Criminals in the CIA**. [Just like the Watergate days](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/03/report-surveillance-led-unmasking-private-names-started-trump-gop-nominee/).

Turns out, again, that [the more outlandish Trump's proclamations, the more right they are](https://hennessysview.com/2017/03/07/many-times-trumps-crazy-statements-turned-out-to-be-right/). As I told you. **Trust Trump**. He's more accurate than CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS, New York Times, Washington Post, and USA Today combined. Trump only sounds crazy because he's the only one telling you the truth.** In a sea of lies, the truth sounds crazy.**

Everyone who mocked or doubted Trump's "wiretap" tweets owes President Trump an apology. That includes Obama sympathizers in the GOP, like Senator John "[Songbird](https://hennessysview.com/2017/02/19/give-mccain-a-break/)" McCain.

_UPDATE_ [Fox News has learned](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/31/intelligence-official-who-unmasked-trump-associates-is-very-high-up-source-says.html) that the official who illegally "unmasked" Trump associates was “very well known, very high up, very senior in the intelligence world." More from Fox:



> Intelligence and House sources with direct knowledge of the disclosure of classified names told Fox News that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., now knows who is responsible -- and that person is not in the FBI.

For a private citizen to be “unmasked,” or named, in an intelligence report is extremely rare. Typically, the American is a suspect in a crime, is in danger or has to be named to explain the context of the report.



Democrats might do a Friday document dump this afternoon. They're realizing the game is over. People will go to prison for this.

_Update 2:_ via [The Gateway Pundit](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/03/unmasking-private-trump-associates-political-purposes-not-national-security/):



> Senior Fox News Correspondent, Adam Housley revealed today that Intel Chair Devin Nunes knows who unmasked Trump and his associates. Sources also told him that the unmasking was purely for political purposes to embarrass Trump and had NOTHING to do with national security.
