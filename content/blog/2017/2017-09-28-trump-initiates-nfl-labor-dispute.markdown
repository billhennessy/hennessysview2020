Yesterday, [I predicted the NFL would suffer a season-shortening labor dispute](https://hennessysview.com/2017/09/27/nfl-losing-a-laugher-video/) this season or next.

The reason: President Trump's pressure on owners to crack down on anthem haters will stir up a fight between NFL Players Association and the owners.

> President Trump, in an exclusive interview with "Fox & Friends," said that NFL owners are “afraid” to act against their players protesting the national anthem at games across the country.

> “The NFL is in a box and they have to do something about it,” Trump told Fox News' Pete Hegseth, in the interview aired Thursday morning.

Trump essentially questioned the owners' manhood. The owners are wealthy business people. Huge egos. Extremely competitive. They will not resist Trump's challenge.

Watch for two things before Sunday:




*1. Several owners will break with their teams and the league by threatening to fine or fire any player who refuses to stand for the national anthem.
*2. The NFLPA will issue a statement threatening to strike if any player is fined or fired for disrespecting the flag.


Healing won't begin until [all the pus is out of the zit](https://hennessysview.com/2017/09/25/president-trump-popped-the-nfls-biggest-zit/).
