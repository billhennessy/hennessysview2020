The leftists who want [you and me to die (at their hands?)](https://hennessysview.com/2017/02/09/people-want-you-dead/) call themselves The Resistance.

Okay. Let's call them that.

Author Steven Pressfield wrote a book about defeating The Resistance. It's called [The War of Art, and it's an awesome](https://amzn.to/2kTXii6), wonderful book.

Overcoming and defeating The Resistance, Pressfield tells us, is the key to living the good life. I agree, even if I don't agree on some of his enemies. The Resistance must be defeated. On that, we definitely agree completely.

**The Resistance hates virtuous actions**. Here are the virtues that Pressfield says conjure up The Resistance in all its diabolical powers. These are the things The Resistance hates:



> 1) **The pursuit of any calling** in writing, painting, music, film, dance, or any creative art, however marginal or unconventional.

2) The launching of **any entrepreneurial venture or enterprise**, for profit or otherwise.

3) Any diet or health regimen.

4) Any program of **spiritual advancement.**

5) Any activity whose aim is tighter abdominals.

6) Any course or program designed to **overcome an unwholesome habit** or addiction.

7) Education of every kind.

8) **Any act of political, moral, or ethical courage**, including the decision to change for the better some unworthy pattern of thought or conduct in ourselves.

9) The undertaking of **any enterprise or endeavor whose aim is to help others**.

10) **Any act that entails commitment of the heart**. The decision to get married, to have a child, to weather a rocky patch in a relationship.

11) The taking of **any principled stand in the face of adversity**. In other words, **any act that rejects immediate gratification** in favor of long-term growth, health, or integrity. Or, expressed another way, **any act that derives from our higher nature instead of our lower**. Any of these will elicit Resistance.



Oh, Mr. Pressfield, you know The Resistance so well. So well.

The book then lists The Resistance's nature:




** Invisible
** Internal
** **Insidious**
** Implacable
** Impersonal
** Infallible
** Universal
** Never Sleeps
** Plays for Keeps
** Fueled by Fear
** **Only Opposes in One Direction** (this short topic alone makes the book worth buying or borrowing)
** Is Most Powerful at the Finish Line (like the Boston Marathon Bombers)
** **Recruits Allies**


Finally, (well, not finally for the book, but finally for this post), Pressfield reminds us that The Resistance can be beaten:



> If Resistance couldn't be beaten, there would be no Fifth Symphony, no Romeo and Juliet, no Golden Gate Bridge. Defeating Resistance is like giving birth. It seems absolutely impossible until you remember that women have been pulling it off successfully, with support and without, for fifty million years.



Yesterday, [you heard about the climax of the Fourth Turning](https://hennessysview.com/?p=21535). You were teased about the Gray Champion. You might have heard [Senator Marco Rubio concurring with my grim conclusion](https://ijr.com/2017/02/798259-watch-marco-rubio-become-the-biggest-adult-in-dc-as-he-eloquently-dismantles-elizabeth-warren/?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=owned&utm_campaign=ods&utm_term=ijamerica&utm_content=politics) on all this. Soon, you'll meet the Gray Champion and understand why I'm so certain that [The Fourth Turning](https://amzn.to/2kTWqKs)'s prophecy is coming true before our very eyes.
