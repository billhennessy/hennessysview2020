I'll set the over-under on Priebus's resignation/firing at 10 days (August 6).

Pick over or under in the comments.

Winners will get great satisfaction.

I'm taking under.

If you don't know what I'm talking about, [Gateway Pundit has it all. It's juicy!](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/07/shock-scaramucci-wants-fbi-to-investigate-reince-priebus-for-leaking-his-financial-disclosure/)

Just yesterday, Washington Times pointed out that the very swampy [Priebus is increasingly isolated and lonely](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jul/26/reince-priebus-loss-of-white-house-allies-bad-sign/) in the Trump White House. Nobody likes Reince.
