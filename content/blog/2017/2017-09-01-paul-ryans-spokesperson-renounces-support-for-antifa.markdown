It was probably a coincidence.

One day after [Hennessy's View reported Speaker Paul "Dumbbell" Ryan as a member of the Antifa caliphate support team](https://hennessysview.com/2017/08/30/a-military-strategists-view-of-antifa/), Speaker Ryan's office renounced his membership in the terrorist group's fan club.

As reported by [The Gateway Pundit](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/08/hell-freezes-paul-ryan-finally-condemns-antifa-violence-shamed/):



> Social media was set ablaze after Paul Ryan attacked President Trump for condemning ‘both sides’ for the violence in Charlottesville. Trump supporters hammered Paul Ryan for refusing to condemn Antifa. It turns out the shaming worked. Finally.

The pressure mounted on Speaker Ryan after left-wing lunatic Nancy Pelosi released a [statement](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/08/nancy-pelosi-finally-condemns-antifa-violence-paul-ryan-still-silent/) Tuesday condemning Antifa violence in Berkeley.



Many people are asking two questions about Ryan's belated comments on Antifa:




  1. What the hell took so long?
  2. Why hasn't Ryan himself denounced Antifa?




And I'll throw out one more question that I know you're asking yourself:




  1. Did Hennessy's View influence the Ryan spokesperson's comments?


While we wait for the Speaker to answer these questions, we look toward Mitt Romney. Will Mittens join Ryan and Nancy Pelosi in denouncing Antifa's terrorism? What about John "Song Bird" McCain?

Do you think Ryan, McCain, and Romney really supported Antifa? Or were they just afraid to voice their fear and loathing of Antifa? I can't decide.
