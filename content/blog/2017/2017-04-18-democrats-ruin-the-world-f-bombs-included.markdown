Picture this.

Every time you leave your teenage kids home alone for a weekend, you come back to stink-eyes from yourÂ neighbors, a living room that's a sea of empty beer cans, a yard filled with cigarette butts, and a pregnant cat.

Pretty soon, you'd stop leaving those kids to their own devices, wouldn't you? If you had to leave town, you'd find a sitter. Maybe a retired Marine uncle. Or a friendly cop to send a car by the house every half hour during the dark hours. But you wouldn't let the behavior continue.

Now, think about how **Democrats fuck up the world every time** they get into the White House.




** Kennedy/Johnson left Vietnam for Nixon
** Carter left the Soviet Union, Afghanistan, and Iran Hostage Crisis for Reagan
** Clinton left North Korea and al Qaeda for Bush
** Obama left a nuclear North Korea, [Syria](https://www.businessinsider.com/official-slams-obama-i-think-he-left-a-more-dangerous-world-2017-4), Russia, China, Libya, Egypt, Ukraine, and a dozen other geopolitical nightmares for Trump


What's worse is we elected those Republicans (excepting Nixon) largely to deal with problems at home. But each of those presidents had to spend his first term on foreign policy. Not because they wanted to. Because **Democrats had actively fucked up the entire world** while they were in charge.

Face it: international relations is just too complicated a subject for a Democrat's brain. They're not equipped for the challenge.

**Democrats handle geopolitics like a cat handles an iPad**. Sure, they can stomp on the icons and make sound come out, but the cat thinks it's stepping on bugs when it's actually tweeting out your online banking password. But you get million YouTube views for the video, so it all evens out.

Maybe you don't want to think about foreign policy. Maybe you don't want to deal with the fact that we are closer to nuclear war than we've been . . . ever. Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter managed to help North Korea get nuclear weapons and ICBMs. Carter told Kim Jong-un's grandfather, Kim Il-song, to do whatever he wants; we'll bring the casserole.

**Now, Il-song's deranged, inbred grandson has nukes and a million bottles of inherited Hennessy**. He's murdered his wife and her band, his brother, uncles, and thousands of others. He holds 100s of thousands of people in concentration camps. And he has a hard-on for using those nukes Grandpappy Il-song left him.

Two of my kids are within range of Kim Jong-un's weapons. One is on shore duty with the Navy on the island of Guam. The other serves in the Navy with a helo combat squadron assigned to the [USS Nimitz](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/04/report-two-u-s-aircraft-carriers-deployed-korean-peninsula/). So, I have some skin in this game. But this isn't about my fatherly worry. It's about my responsibility as a voter. And yours.

As a voter, I'm kind of like the government's parent. As a parent, **I won't leave Democrats home alone again.** They're irresponsible, immature, and kind of stupid. That's why they're drawn to safer careers like acting, journalism, and university professorships. Those are good jobs for irresponsible, stupid people.

Respect the planet. Don't ever vote Democrat.
