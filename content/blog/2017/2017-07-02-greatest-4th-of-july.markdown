President Trump makes everything better. Everything. And this video, which he just tweeted, made this 4th of the July the best since 1776. (Click twice to get play this video)

The left and CNN will, of course, be outraged. They don't have a sense of humor.

President Trump has a fine sense of humor. I can see the grin on his face as he tapped out "#FraudNewsCNN" and hit the send button.

I know this is very un-Christian of me, but I have to admit something. It makes me happy to know that Trump's wrestling video will ruin the holiday for hundreds of reporters, editors, producers, Hollywood outrage pornographers, and Never Trumpers. Ruin their holiday. **I can see Jim Acosta screaming at his wife across the kitchen table now**. "Why no corn-on-the-cob? Why no corn-on-the-cob? Why no corn-on-the-cob?" He might even get a drink thrown in his face.

Some will say that a video like this one is beneath the president. **Sanctimonious puffery**. Bill Clinton sort of blew those standards of decorum.

Besides, everybody who ever said they wanted new blood and fresh faces in politics? **This is what non-political outsiders look like**. They don't play by your old rules because those rules were meant to preserve the elites. The rules of decorum you worry about were designed to keep Tea Partiers barefoot and parading, not winning elections. Those old rules from the 19th century were written to keep the common rabble (rabble like you, me, and Trump) away from politics.

When we stormed the steps of the Arch in 2009, **we became the battering ram striking the first blow into the gates of the palace**. When Donald J. Trump took the oath of office in January 2017, those palace gates swung open. Just as the American army of rabble and peasants humiliated the great British Empire at Yorktown 236 years ago.

Cornwallis's words in The Patriot are Jeff Zucker's words today. (Click anywhere on the video to play)

Everything has changed. Everything except the elite's contempt for the people who make America great.

Keep tweeting, Mr. President. Your enemies deserve it.
