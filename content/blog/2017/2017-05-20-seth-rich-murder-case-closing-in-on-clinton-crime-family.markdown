Was Seth Rich murdered as an example?

Seth Rich was murdered. Two gunshots to his back. Like you'd see on The Sopranos ([video](https://youtu.be/fc5QWxQ_leI)). The police called it a robbery. But nothing was stolen. Not his cell phone. Not his wallet. Not his watch. Not his cash.

Shortly after his murder, Wikileaks posted embarrassing emails. Emails from the Democratic National Committee's email server. Wikileaks maintains that the theft of the emails was an inside job. The FBI, the DNC, and others say the Russians did it.

For perspective, let's look at an email exchange between Hillary's campaign chairman John Podesta, her campaign manager Robby Mook, and Joel Benenson.

No one – literally no one talked to the press in either Obama campaign without clearing it with campaign brass.



John Podesta replied:

Agree. Happy to talk to the David's. Call me crazy, but I think if we can survive the next month, it will be possible, maybe even straightforward to get our arms around this once there is an actual campaign.** I'm definitely for making an example of a suspected leaker whether or not we have any real basis for it.**



So, Podesta was down with making an example of a suspected leaker, even without evidence or proof of a leak. Sort of like a mafia boss, right?

And Mook was all for it, too.

Read the whole email thread on [Wikileaks](https://www.wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/36082#efmAGSAH-).









Kim Dotcom revealed today that he helped Seth Rich transfer those DNC emails to Wikileaks. Via [The Gateway Pundit](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/05/boom-hacker-kim-dotcom-knew-seth-rich-wikileaks-source-involved/):

Later, Dotcom announced he will release details on Tuesday, after conferring with his lawyers on Monday.

The Seth Rich murder weapon inches ever closer to John Podesta's trigger finger. It looks more an more like the whole Russian conspiracy theory was an elaborate cover to hide a DNC or Hillary hit job on Seth Rich.
