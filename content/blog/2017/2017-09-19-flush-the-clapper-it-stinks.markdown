James Clapper lied to Chuck Todd.

Clapper wiretapped Paul Manafort and lied about it. [Just like Trump said](https://hennessysview.com/2017/09/18/trump-was-right-obama-white-house-wiretapped-paul-manafort/).

James Clapper looks like a kind old grandfather. Like Josef Stalin. Or an elderly Charles Manson.

Like Stalin and Manson, **Clapper's soiled name deserves to be flushed into the bowels of history's bio hazard tank. **

[James Clapper categorically denied that anyone associated with the Trump campaign was ever wiretapped.](https://www.mediaite.com/columnists/remember-when-james-clapper-categorically-denied-any-wiretap-against-trump-campaign/) He lied.

James Clapper swore he'd have known of any FISA court request for a wiretap of any Trump associate. And then **he swore by inclusion that Paul Manafort was never wiretapped. **

Now we know Clapper is a liar. He lied to cover his criminal attempt to illegally steal the election.

Clapper is a liar. Flush the Clapper.
