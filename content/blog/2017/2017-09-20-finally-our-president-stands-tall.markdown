They were dumbfounded.

Those United Nations stuffed shirts were dumbfounded. Struck dumb. Silenced. Shocked. Floored.

Those sissy diplomats were shaken. Appalled. Frightened.

Never in the sordid history of the United Nations has an American president spoken in unvarnished truth in unvarnished terms.

Trump has the best words.

Trump used his best words today.

The best of the best.

Trump called Kim Jung Un "Rocket Man." The funniest and most effective linguistic kill-shot to date. A Twitter line. And Trump pulled it off at the United bygod Nations.

[Scott Adams can't stop laughing about Rocket Man tweet!]

They were shocked.

But it gets better. Rocket Man came AFTER Trump promised to completely destroy North Korea!

About damn time a US President warned the world one of its nations might go away. Like Atlantis. Poof! Gone. Adios.

Read our president's best words:












> The United States has great strength and patience,, but if it is forced to de fend itself or its allies,, we will have no choice but to **totally destroy North Korea**.. **Rocket man is on a suicide mission** for himself and for his regime...









Boom! If only Reagan had spoken so bluntly to the UN. Folks, I'm 53 years old. I've hated the United Nations since the 1970s. I've prayed for a president who would finally reign in that rogue, globalist disaster.

Beautiful. Beautiful words. Beautiful speech. Wonderful.

Our president also got the UN socialists to applaud his takedown of socialism. Huge!


















> The problem in Venezuela is not that socialism has been poorly implemented, but that socialism has been faithfully implemented.. [ Applause ]

From the soviet union to Cuba to Venezuela, **wherever true socialism or communism has been adopted, it has delivered anguish and devastation and failure**. Those who preach the tenants of these discredited ideologies, only contribute to the continued suffering of the people who live under these cruel systems.









Awesome. Ronald Reagan never tore down socialism more eloquently. And Trump spoke those words to the body that fosters and promotes socialism around the world. The wicked United Nations.

If that's all Trump had said, he'd have said more than any US president ever said to the United Nations. But Trump said so much more. And all of it 100% pharmaceutical grade brilliance. Like this:

I have never loved a president as much as I love President Trump. Love him. Not ashamed to say it. I love my president.

Now, this.
