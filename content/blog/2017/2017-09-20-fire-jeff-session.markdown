Greg Jarrett thinks Jeff Sessions should resign. I do, too.

I felt like the lone voice on the right last week when I wrote "[Counseling Sessions](https://hennessysview.com/2017/09/10/counselling-sessions/)." It feels great to have Greg Jarrett agree: Jeff Sessions should resign.

[As Jarrett puts it](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/09/19/gregg-jarrett-sessions-should-resign-but-not-before-taking-action-against-clinton-comey-and-rice.html):



> Sessions appears either incapable or incompetent.  He has resisted producing the documents relevant to the anti-Trump dossier which were subpoenaed by the House Intelligence Committee.  He has failed to appoint a special counsel to reopen the case against Hillary Clinton for likely violations of the Espionage Act in the use of her email server, obstruction of justice for destroying 33,000 emails under congressional subpoena, and potential self-dealing for profit through her foundation.  The evidence is compelling.



Before that, [Jarrett pointed out a character flaw](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/09/19/gregg-jarrett-sessions-should-resign-but-not-before-taking-action-against-clinton-comey-and-rice.html) in Jeff Session—a character flaw I had overlooked.



> Jeff Sessions should never have accepted the position of Attorney General of the United States.  **His leadership has proven unproductive and ineffectual**.





> There are two reasons for this.





> First, **he deceived President Trump by concealing his intent to recuse himself from the federal investigation into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election**.  Hours after he was sworn in, Sessions began setting his recusal in motion by meeting with Department of Justice officials to discuss stepping aside from the probe.  Failing to disclose such a material matter to the president was an egregious betrayal.



Not only is Sessions incompetent and low energy, he's also deceptive. He's also disloyal, working at cross-purposes to the president who appointed him.

When Trump tweeted criticisms of Sessions earlier this year, conservatives howled and demanded Trump back off. Conservatives were wrong to do so.

**Conservatives were wrong to defend Jeff Sessions**. Conservatives put their faith in the wrong man.

Jeff Sessions is a failed attorney general. His credibility and his honesty are in tatters. His Department of Justice is only slightly improved over Loretta Lynch's. Few people would notice if Sessions stopped showing up for work altogether.

My disgust with Sessions magnified when we learned about the wiretap of Trump Tower. James Comey committed perjury over this issue. Jeff Sessions has known Comey committed perjury at least as long as Trump has known. Yet Sessions has done nothing.

Is Sessions protecting Comey, or is Jeff Session incompetent? Completely incompetent?

Greg Jarrett wants Session to fix a few of his errors, then resign. **I would be happy if Trump fired Sessions tomorrow.**
