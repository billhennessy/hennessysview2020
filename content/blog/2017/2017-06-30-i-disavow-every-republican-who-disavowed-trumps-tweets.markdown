When Reagan was president, we wanted him to hit back harder on the press. We wanted him to put Sam Donaldson in his place. We wanted him to call out the fake news.

But Reagan didn't.

Reagan was a gentleman.

We respected that.

But we wanted him to break form and hit those bastards hard. With his brilliant wit.

When Trump punched Mika and Joe in their surgically-lifted faces this morning, I laughed. I cheered.

They had it coming. They EARNED a presidential takedown. They earned it. They got it.

When Nancy Pelosi, former lube rack swimsuit model, took to the podium to call Trump sexist, I laughed. What a stupid hypocrite Pelosi.

When I heard Republicans disavowing Trump's tweets, I yelled. Almost cried like Chuck Schumer.

Republicans are so weak. Weak Republicans. Man up.

The press deserves every ounce of scorn, ridicule, and condemnation it gets. There's no life form lower than a lefty journalist. When low-IQ idiots like Mika Brzezinski get called out by a president, they have it coming. It's just. It's deserved.

I am damn proud that my president remains true to his rallying, street-fighter campaign. I'm proud that Trump verbally punches stupidity in its plastic-surgery-lifted face (as Michelle Moore might say).

I hope Trump's tweets hurt their feelings. Screw their feeling.

Trump isn't Reagan. Trump is the Wolf. Trump gets the job done. He's filling the gaps Reagan left open. He's punching stupidity in the mouth. And you love it.

Keep winning, Donald. We love you.
