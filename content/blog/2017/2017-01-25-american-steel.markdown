I know people, and you probably do too, who are out of work from the United Steel Granite City (aka Granite City Steel) closure. It's disheartening and depressing for people who worked hard all those years, thrown into the street because of bad trade deals and stifling regulations.

But President Trump has ordered the Keystone Pipeline renegotiated to require American steel pipes. That's great news for our friends and neighbors in GC.

Today, Mr. Trump is expected to sign executive orders to begin construction of the border wall, construction already authorized and funded by Congress. That construction, too, will include American steel.

Isn't it great to get our fine steelworkers back to work?

Winning.
