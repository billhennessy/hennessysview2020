Congress is about to pass a budget. I call it a "Paul Ryan Special." This budget lets the government spend money for four months. It expires in September.

The budget is horrible. Republicans are spinning a few "wins" in the budget, but that's a terrible argument. It's like telling a terminal cancer patient, "but your blood pressure's pretty good."

Here's the thing: you cannot control Congress. You can only control what you focus on and what you do next. That's it. That's all anyone can control.

Sure, you can _influence_ people. If you capture their attention, bypass their critical thinking, and trigger their subconscious mind. That's how you influence. But you cannot control. What they do next is up to them. What you do next is up to you.

I've learned that making fun of Paul Ryan on Twitter does no good. He's not reading my tweets.

I'm, instead, focusing on improving my work. If I improve my work, the economy might grow. If the economy grows, people will give Trump credit. If Trump gets credit for the economy, he'll get more positive attention by September. If Trump has positive attention in Congress, he'll have more influence over Paul Ryan and Democrats.

People want a vibrant economy. People want to choose between several good job offers. No one wants to feel trapped in a low-paying job they don't like. People want options. You want options.

I can't fix the economy myself, but I can do my job better. And that will make my company and its clients better. If enough other people do the same, the economy will grow.

The other thing people want is safety. People want to be safe. What good is a great job if you get shot walking into work?

If President Trump makes America safe again, he will earn more positive attention. With more positive attention, his influence in Congress will increase.

I can't do much about safety, but my kids can. I have two sons in the Navy and one who will soon be a firefighter. They keep us safe. I can choose to support them and their careers. That's how I can make America safer. It's not much, but it's in my control.

You, like me, hate this 4-month budget. But I'm not freaking out. It'll be over in four months. That's about the same amount of time that Trump's been in office. See how time flies?

It will be okay.
