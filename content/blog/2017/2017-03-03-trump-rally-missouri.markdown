President Trump needs our support and hundreds of Missourians have already RSVP'd that they'll be attending! It's clear he is being severely pressured by Democrats and the media alike. Our rally will send an important message to our new Commander in Chief--We The People support you! Find the Facebook event page by clicking here.

These pro-Trump rallies are happening on Saturday across the entire USA - don't miss the Missouri statewide rally in Jefferson City! Attendance is looking excellent, and the updated flier is below.
