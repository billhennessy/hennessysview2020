In 2012, Barack Obama got caught telling Russian Prime Minister Medvedev that he'd have more "flexibility" after the election.

Later in 2012, during a debate, Obama accused GOP candidate Mitt Romney of stoking Cold War fears against our new friends in Moscow.  Obama said, “The 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because…t**he Cold War’s been over for 20 years!**” In fact, in 2012, the whole [pantheon of pantsuit ](https://thefederalist.com/2016/07/25/5-times-liberals-mocked-mitt-romney-for-warning-about-russia/)partiers[ mocked warnings about Russia](https://thefederalist.com/2016/07/25/5-times-liberals-mocked-mitt-romney-for-warning-about-russia/).

Now, of course, Obama won't be satisfied until Trump goes to condition 1SQ for strategic launch (spin up all missiles) against the Russians. Warmongers.

Democrats everywhere scream ["The Russians are coming! The Russians are coming!"](https://hennessysview.com/2017/03/03/the-russians-are-coming-the-russians-are-coming/)

Funny.
