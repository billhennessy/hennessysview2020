James Comey exonerated Hillary Clinton _three months before_ he interviewed her.

James Comey exonerated Hillary Clinton _before_ interviewing 16 key witnesses.

James Comey exonerated Hillary Clinton _before_ he gathered any significant evidence.

James Comey gave Hillary Clinton permission to destroy evidence in a felony investigation.

James Comey leaked classified information to the media.

These are all facts. No one disputes them.

They are all crimes of various degrees. Some felonies.

At the time James Comey committed these crimes, he was head of the FBI.

Because of James Comey's felonies, the FBI probably needs to be disbanded. Shut down. Destroyed. Eliminated.

No one can trust anything the FBI does.

No one can trust anyone who works at the FBI.

Every FBI employee lost most of their credibility today.

Because of James Comey.

And his accessory after the fact, Robert Mueller.

If I were a member of Congress, I would vote against any bill that provided funding to the FBI. Any funding. I'd shit it down.

Once, FBI agents were my heroes. Many former FBI agents still are heroes to me.

But the FBI itself is a criminal organization. Like the mafia. Like a drug cartel. Like the SS. Like the KGB.

The FBI uses its power to destroy political opponents and to protect itself.

James Comey ruined the FBI. For that, every American should demand Comey's prosecution.

Lawyer up, Jimmy. Your days are numbered.
