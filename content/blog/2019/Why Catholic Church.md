Why Catholic Church

I further believe the Catholic Church, which took the lead in directly countering the influence of demons for centuries has fallen largely under the spell of Satan. It has inhaled too much of what Pope Paul VI called "the smoke of Satan." 

Pope Paul recognized that the smoke of Satan had wasted into the Church. But too late. By the time Pope Paul smelled the smoke, a generation of cardinals and bishops were already high on its evil fumes, intoxicated with the carnal pleasures of this world, this world which Satan rules (John 12:31). 

The Catholic Church alone provides her people with special tools, called sacramentals, that have power over demons. These include the crucifix, holy water, blessed salt, the Holy Rosary, and others. But the Church leaders of Vatican II, stoned on the smoke of Satan, weakened these tools dramatically. It also weakened all of the holy sacraments give by our Lord.

Most Catholics don't know this, but Vatican II eliminated the exorcisms from the sacraments, making them weaker. The new Baptism, for instance, eliminates all but one exorcism, and that one is only a shell of its former self. 

Still, Catholics can get their hands on traditionally exorcised and blessed salt, water, and other sacramentals. They just have to find a Traditional Latin Mass priest. 

And how do we know these holy tools work?
