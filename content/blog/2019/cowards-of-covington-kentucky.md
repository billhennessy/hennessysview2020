**Note: I have limited exposure to the news because of a religious observance. I apologize if any of the situations described below have been overcome by events.**

No news story has affected me more powerfully than this one: thugs, from the Catholic bishop of Covington diocese to a 64-year-old Native American activist, targeted a group of pro-life high school boys for ridicule, slander, and life-ruining accusations. 

Think about that. How effective must Satan be to have turned a Catholic bishop against the best young men in his diocese? 

Oh, wait. Catholic priests, bishops, and cardinals have been attacking fine young men for decades, haven't they? But never like this.

Moreover, Catholics who claim to be conservatives have also lined up to ruin these kids' lives. Hugh Hewitt, a conservative lawyer and talk show host, refuses to back down from his attacks on the victims days later. Hewitt, who promotes himself as the conscience of the conservative movement, believes the Covington boys behaved poorly by standing still, smiling, and performing their school spirit chants. I believe Hewitt is afraid of speaking the truth. Afraid the truth will bring a rebuke from his media and art friends on the left, friendships he honors more than truth.
