### Winter

In the Soviet Union, finding a priest was hard. Catholics and Russian Orthodox tell stories of going through the motions of Mass on Sundays, with the priest's vestments laid out on a table. With no priests, there was no sacrifice, no Communion, no transubstantiation, no Real Presence. No confession, either. No confirmations or ordinations. No extreme unction. 

Sacred weddings could still occur because of hardship. And baptisms, of course. But that's it. 

Whether all the stories of infiltration and intentional sabotage are true or not, the result is the same. The Church in America is about to be reduced to a few pockets of traditionalists organizing regional masses with a circuit of faithful priests. Catholicism in America will soon look Catholicism in the Soviet Union. 

For the faithful, it will actually be a blessing. It will be their chance to carry a cross with Christ. Faithful Catholics will have to work doubly hard to avoid sin, since confession won't be available often. 

But the joy felt when a priest finally comes to town will make the suffering seem worth it. 

On those few, glorious days each year, the Catholics will dress in their best suits and dresses. They'll jealously clutch their worn and beautiful Roman Missals as they fast-walk the last mile to the safe house where, they were told, the priest will be. They'll pray silent Aves and Pater Nosters on the way. Praying that they make it in time, that they didn't get the time or location wrong, that there will be room for them, that there will be enough Communion for everyone. 

Most of all, they'll pray that the secret police don't arrest the priest right in front of them. In front of their children. In their town. (Here, they'll remember Christ's instruction to His disciples to kick the dust off their feet when leaving an unwelcoming village.) Or, worse, that the Antircs (Anti-Roman Catholic) don't storm the safe house and kill them all. 

They won't want to ponder that grim though long, though, so they start humming chants: Ave Maria, Salve Regina, Te Deum, Veni Creator Spiritus. Hum, never sing. Hostile ears are attuned to the sound of Latin. Singing a chant would give them away. (Here, they tuck their missals a little closer to their bodies so wandering eyes don't notice the faded ribbons dangling from the spine.)

Then, the special knock. The mother stops short of the door of the safe house and fans out her arms to corral the children. The father takes a deep, nervous breath and wades through his family to the solid oak door with black steel hinges. He repeats the knock pattern in his head: knock twice, count to three, knock once more. 

The father looks at it wife and feels shamed by the worry in her eyes. He wonders if God is happy or angry that he's placed his family in this danger. 

When his friend Gabriel told him about the clandestine Mass, he didn't think twice. "Oh, thank God. Praise Jesus," he said. "Thank you for telling me. Yes, of course, we'll be there. When is it again? Four weeks from Sunday? Is that the 14th?"

But, now, looking at this wife and their children, he wonders. And knocks:

Klonk-klonk. (One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi) KLONK!

They wait. To their father, the older children look concerned. The younger children look excited. 

The door opens a crack, limited by an iron bar. Whoever opened the door says nothing. 

"We're the Sandersons. Gabriel Flynn told us the game is on here today." 

The door shuts softly, then quickly reopens wide. A woman's hand  waves the family in, quickly. Almost frantically. But the woman doesn't speak. 

Mr. Sanderson waits gently pushes the children through the door, then his wife, then he crosses the threshold himself. As he does, he feels the breeze from the door shutting quickly behind him. 

A woman of about forty, wearing a chapel veil looks at each of the Sandersons. She has one of those faces whose neutral expression is a soft smile. She doesn't speak. Just bows her head slightly and turns to lead the family out of the foyer and through the large living room and deeper into the large, brick home they'd never seen before.
