Why did I fall for the world's empty promises?
The promise of happiness, 
I lunged for it.
The promise of sex with beautiful women,
I scaled walls for it.
The promise of power,
I lost sleep over it.
The promise of being loved,
I made excuses for it.
The promise of being esteemed,
I wrote books for it.
The promise of being exalted,
I turned from friends for it.
The promise of being honored,
I ignored my children for it.
The promise of being praised,
I abandoned the Lord for it.
The promise of being preferred,
I dishonored my parents for it.
The promise of being consulted,
I centered my life around it.
The promise of being approved,
I lied to get it. 

And the world kept its promises for a moment.
And the rewards faded like paper in the sun.

Why did I fear the world's empty threats?
The threat of humiliation,
I blamed others to dodge it.
The threat of beign despised,
I bit my tongue to miss it.
The threat of being rebuked,
I hid in the shadows to avoid it.
The threat of false accusations,
I softened my words to thwart it.
The threat of being ridiculed,
I offered others to take my place.
The threat of being suspected,
I took a safer path around it.

In all these things I denied the Lord. Denied Him like Peter.
In all these things I earned the world's praise and the angels' scorn.

But the Lord knew my heart in all its weakness.
The Lord heard my accusations hurled in my dreams. 
The Lord took the punishment for my weakness.
The Lord wore the throny crown that fits my head.
He accepted the spite that I earned with my silence.
He was rebuked for my cowardice.
He was accused of my lies.
He was riduled for my errors. 
He was suspected of my crimes.

He asked nothing in return except a closer walk with me.
When the world's empty promises faded and the notes of its music faded in the wind,
The Lord stood patiently waiting for me to get over myself and the world and walk along with Him.
The table is set.
Supper is waiting.
