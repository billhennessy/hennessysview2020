Scott Adams says Donald Trump lives his life like a movie or television series. (See [*Looking Ahead to Season Four of Trump*](https://www.hennessysview.com/2017/12/29/looking-ahead-to-season-four-of-trump-the-president/) for a complete explanation.) Being New Year's Eve, it's time to look back on Season Five (2019) and, then, look ahead to season six (2020) of Trump.

### Season Five: Mueller Report and Ukraine Hoax

Going into 2019, the Fed had slowed the incredible Trump Economy with aggressive interest rate hikes. But the Trump Economy overcame those speed bumps to post the greatest year in the history of the US economy:

* Unemployment 3.4%
* Black unemployment: lowest ever
* Hispanic unemployment: lowest ever
* Working-class wages: up more than in over a decade
* Inflation: low
* Real wages: way up
* Stock markets: Record high closes almost every week
* Summary: Best Economy Ever thanks to Trump

Meanwhile, the world awaited the Mueller Report. It was a dud. Trump did nothing wrong. No collusion. Mueller looked like a dementia patient on the stand at the hearing. Horrible.

Democrats lost their minds. Trump roared. The economy grew.

But almost immediately, the Democrats and their Deep State invented a new hoax: Ukraine. And, as I predicted in 2017, with control of the House, the Democrats immediately pursued impeachment.

Which brings us to 2020.

### Season Six: Impeachment, China, Iran

In Season Six of Trump: Your President, three sub-plots will unfold: impeachment, China, and Iran.

At some point, the House will probably send over two articles of impeachment. This impeachment hoax has turned out to be the greatest boon to the Republican Party since Democrats went all-in on slavery and secession in 1860. 

If crazy Nancy Pelosi decides to hold the articles forever, Trump will win in a landslide, and the Republicans will take back the House of Representatives. 

If crazy Nancy refers the articles to the Senate, the trial will last three weeks, Trump will be exonerated and acquitted, and Hunter and Joe Biden will come under increasing public pressure to surrender to law enforcement. Trump will win in a landslide, but Republicans might not take back the House. 

The reason for the different House outcomes based on Nancy's choice is simple. If the House does not send the articles of impeachment to the Senate, everyone will know that the House inquiries were pure political theatre. If, however, Nancy sends the articles, Democrats will at least be able to say (however falsely) they followed the process. The Democrats are far better off losing at trial than folding now. 

On China, look for the final trade agreement to be signed in March, about the time a Democrat presidential candidate looks certain. This is because the Chinese will realize they have to deal with Trump five more years, so they might as well get the best deal they can now. No matter who wins the Democrat nomination, they won't be able to lay a hand on Trump, but the Chinese are holding out hope someone powerful emerges from the pack. (Aint' gonna happen.)

On Iran, unless the Iraq government quells the Iranian attackers, Trump will use overwhelming force in the aftermath of the US embassy attack in Iraq. Look for massive ground action in Iraq and Hollywood-style air attacks in Iran. The UN and the Vatican will strongly condemn the United States, but the world will find out Trump doesn't mess around. By July, Iran will capitulate.

### Summary

The results will be a stronger economy and more stable world. Trump will head into October with the highest approval rating of a president facing re-election since Reagan in 1984.

Check back next year to see how right I was.
