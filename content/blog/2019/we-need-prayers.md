Please spread the word. Tweet this. Post to Facebook. If you're Catholic, please forward to your parish office and ask for a blurb in the Sunday bulletin. 

Our nation, the Catcholic Church, and the whole world needs prayer. Why? Just read this post. 

St. Padre Pio's respond to problems was, "Bring me my *weapon*!" His weapon was his Holy Rosary. He prayed the Rosary to combat sin and evil. And it worked!

Join thousands (maybe 100s of thousands) across the world on Sunday, October 13, 2019, as we pray the Most Holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary. 

Location: We've requested the South Grand Staircase at the Gateway Arch. (Same location as the first Tea Party in 2009.) We have not received final approval from the Parks Department. (Watch Hennessy's View for updates.)

We have asked one of the greatest Catholic preachers in America to speak. I will fill you in once all the logistics are confirmed, but we have a tentative "yes." 

The plan is simple:

* Park on the Wharf (Leonor K. Sullivan Blvd.) 
* Walk to the South stairs of the Arch
* 2:30 PM: Welcome* 2:40 PM: A few words
* 3:00 PM: The Glorious Mysteries
* 3:25 PM: Farewell

I know this is a short program, but it will be powerful. We'd like to have at least 200 people participate at this location in St. Louis. And you'll have plenty of time to enjoy a beautiful fall day in Downtown St. Louis!

You do not have to be Catholic to attend, but the prayer will be the Rosary. 

For more information, please the [Rosary Coast-to-Coast website](https://rosarycoasttocoast.com/clarion-call-to-arms/).

Finally, if you're not in the greater St. Louis area, [check out this map](https://rosarycoasttocoast.com/rosary-coast-to-coast-map/) of Rosary Coast-to-Coast sites from coast to coast!

P.S. We did this last year, too. [Here's the announcement](https://www.hennessysview.com/2018/09/18/rosary-coast-to-coast-october-7-pray-for-america/)
