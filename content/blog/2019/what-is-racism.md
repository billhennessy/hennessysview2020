Martin Luther King told us to judge people by the content of their character, not by the color of their skin. That makes sense to me, and I try to live by it. 

But judging people by the content of their character, and by their competence, is considered racist today. In fact, our society seems to have rejected and reversed Dr. King's dream. People like Nancy Pelosi now say that we need to judge everyone by their race. And the left seems to believe that black Congressmen are incapable of helping their districts.

### Are Black People Inferior?

Do leftists like Pelosi believe black people are genetically unable to handle criticism? Does Pelosi believe blacks are genetically unable to improve their immediate environment?

That seems to be the message coming from Democrats Nancy Pelosi, Elizabeth Warren, and others. That black men, because of some genetic trait, cannot be criticized no matter what they do or say. They cannot be held to the same standard we hold white Congressmen to. 

When President Trump pointed out that Rep. Elijah Cummings' district in Baltimore is a rat-infested crime dump, the left and the media went berserk hurling accusations of racism. Pelosi and other believe that it is racist to expect black Congressmen to live up to the same standards we hold white Congressmen to. Therefore, pointing out the problems of a black Congressman's district is unfair since there's nothing he can do about it. 

Trump apparently doesn't look at a failing Congressman's skin color before pronouncing judgment. He sees a rat-infested crime dump and calls it a rat-infested crime dump. Trump doesn't care what color the Congressman is. He just wants the dump cleaned up. 

Martin Luther King would probably agree with Trump. The people who live in Elijah Cummings' rat-infested crime dump probably want better lives, but Mr. Cummings isn't improving things for them. He's making a lot of money from his wife's company that, in turn, makes a lot of money from his wife's non-profit. (A more cynical person might think [Cummings' wife uses the non-profit as a front to line her own pockets while giving big donors a legal conduit to bribe her husband](https://ijr.com/cummings-wife-may-have-benefitted-from-his-committee-role/), but I'm not cynical like that.)

Dr. King would probably like for the people of Maryland's 7th congressional district to see the place improving every day. But, since Cummings went to Congress things have gotten worse for his constituents. Meanwhile, Mr. Cummings' principal concern is with helping people enter the country illegally.

Maybe Cummings hates illegal immigrants and wants them to come to the USA so he can make them live in the rat-infested crime dump that is his district. 

Whatever Cummings' motivation, he's done a bad job of cleaning up the problems in his district, except the problems of his household wealth which is very substantial. 


### Baltimore, Maryland Is Absolutely a Toilet

Elijah Cummings is an African-American Congressman from Baltimore, Maryland. His district is undisputedly one of the worst in the country for crime, living conditions, and poverty. Orkin Pest Control says Baltimore has the second-worst rat problem in the country. And, as Bernie Sanders says, Baltimore has a lower life expectancy than North Korea. Sanders called Baltimore a "third-world country" in 2016. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Trump is being called a Liar &amp; Racist for saying West Baltimore is poorly ran by Democrats. <br><br>Well here is a video of West Baltimore and according to Democrats this is beautiful site. They like to see black people living in filth.<br> <a href="https://t.co/rzkbbPQj8R">pic.twitter.com/rzkbbPQj8R</a></p>&mdash; Terrence K.

These are just facts. Baltimore is one of the most dangerous places in Maryland, and Maryland is one of the most dangerous places on the eastern seaboard. It's almost as dangerous as my hometown of St. Louis, Missouri. 

This map of the most dangerous places in Maryland comes from NeighborhoodScout.com:

(Deepest purple = most dangerous)

Why is racist to point this out? Don't we want to identify the worst problems and fix them?

The answer is, it's not racist to want to fix broken cities. It's racist to hold blacks to a lower standard. George Bush calls this "the subtle racism of low expectations." It's the most prevalent form of racism in America today, and it afflicts almost everyone who votes Democrat.  

### Racism Has Been Defined

Racism is not criticizing a black person for the results of his work. That's honesty. 

Racism has a definition, and Democrats don't want you learn it. (Democrats rely on ignorance.) Here's the definition of racism according to the Anti-Defamation League:

> Racism is the belief that a particular race is superior or inferior to another, that a personâ€™s social and moral traits are predetermined by his or her inborn biological characteristics. 

Boom.

Based on the standard accepted definition of racism, Nancy Pelosi, Elizabeth Warren, and everyone else "outraged" by Trump's tweets are the racists. Each believes that Elijah Cummings, because of his race, is incapable of dealing with facts about his wretched congressional district. Each believes that Donald Trump broke a rule of etiquette by criticizing a man who, in their minds, is incapable of improving things. 

### This Is All About Trump Derangement Syndrome

Nancy Pelosi's fake outrage has nothing to do with race. It has everything to do with politics. 

Democrats hate Trump and accuse him of racism no matter what he does. Democrats defend the indefensible if Trump first points out that it's indefensible. If Donald Trump were to say Nazi Germany was highly overrated, Nancy Pelosi would take to the floor to read of litany of things the Nazis did very well. 

All you Republicans who wring your hands over this stuff look silly and slow. Trump is two steps ahead of the Democrats and nine miles ahead of you. 

Trump reminded the voters of Baltimore that they live in a rat-infested crime dump and Democrats made it that way. [Democrats run the most crime-infested cities in the US](http://lawstreetmedia.com/blogs/crime/crime-america-2015-top-10-most-dangerous-cities-over-200000) according to Law Street Media:

1. Detroit, MI - Mayor Mike Duggan - DEMOCRAT
2. Oakland, CA - Mayor Jean Quan - DEMOCRAT
3. Memphis, TN - Mayor A C Wharton - DEMOCRAT
4. St. Louis, MO - Mayor Francis G. Slay - DEMOCRAT
5. Cleveland, OH - Mayor Frank G. Jackson - DEMOCRAT
6. Baltimore, MD - Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake - DEMOCRAT
7. Milwaukee, WI - Mayor Tom Barrett - DEMOCRAT
8. Birmingham, AL - Mayor William A. Bell - DEMOCRAT
9. Newark, NJ - Mayor Ras Baraka - DEMOCRAT
10. Kansas City, MO - Mayor Sly James - Independent (but probably a DEMOCRAT)

The people who suffer most because of their Democrat mayors and city councils are usually minorities. What, then, could be more racist than ignoring the plight of the poor by refusing to criticize the results of the elites like Elijah Cummings? 

To me, the racists in this case are the people who defend the status quo in dumpster cities like Baltimore. They seem to believe problems in cities like Baltimore can't be fixed because of the race of their Congressman. 

That's racist, and it's horrible.
