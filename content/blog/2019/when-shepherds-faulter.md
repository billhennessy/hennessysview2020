Sheep get a bad wrap. 

Most people think that, without the constant protection of a human shepherd, sheep would go extinct. But that's not true. 

Sheep were around before people. They managed to have enough off-spring to survive until man domesticated them about 11,000 years ago. Sure, we've bred some of their atavistic traits out of them to make them easier to control, but they're still just a step away from the mouflon ancestors.

I bet if you took away the shepherd, the herd of sheep would survive. 

Yeah, they'd lose a few members to the wolves and whatnot. But the herd would keep going. They'd mate. A dominate male or two would emerge to keep order in the flock and to fight the wolves. 

I mean, dogs were domesticated about 20,000 years before sheep were, and wild dogs do nicely on their own. God's creatures are more resilient than we think. 

### Bishops

The Catholic Church thinks of bishops as shepherds. Blame this analogy on Jesus who told Peter "if you love me, feed my sheep." 

Bishops are supposed to teach the Gospel, administer the sacraments, and guide Christ's people. 

As I pointed out yesterday, the bishops in America aren't doing two of those things: they're not teaching (except for a few), and they're not guiding (except for a few). 

As a result, like sheep, we're losing a few to the wolves. Or, more literally, we're losing people to the "demons who prowel about the world seeking the ruin of souls." Most bishops seem far more frightened by (or in cahoots with) the demons than they worry about losing souls.

But people have been around longer than bishops, and we'll survive without them. 

It won't be easy. Life would be better if the Catholic bishops did their job. But we know better than to count on that. 

Like sheep without a shepherd, Catholics will follow the strong leaders they see emerging from the flock. Bishop or not, we'll follow. 

We'll run from the wolves as long as we can. Then, we'll turn and fight on our own. Priests will take up the job of the bishops. Laymen will step up and fight for the flock. 

We see this happening with men like Bishop Strickland of Tyler, Texas, Fr. Nix, Fr. Heilman, Fr. Ripperger, and many others. Plus laymen like Taylor Marshal, Timothy Gordon, Patrick Coffin, and the like. The sheep are making their own leaders.

The Church hierarchy better realize that this is happening. We're teaching ourselves because the bishops won't. We're improving the sacraments by rejecting the evils of modernism imposed by the bishops after Vatican II. We're guiding each other toward richer, more perfect lives in the faith by studying the early church and its entire history. 

Once a flock of sheep goes feral, you probably can't handle them the way you handled them before. The same goes for Christ's church. The bishops should be very afraid.
