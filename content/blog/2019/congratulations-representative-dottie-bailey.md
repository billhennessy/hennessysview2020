> The one who has the bride is the bridegroom; the best man, who stands and listens for him, rejoices greatly at the bridegroomâ€™s voice. So this joy of mine has been made complete. (Johhn 3:29)

Yesterday, January 9, 2019, was a watershed day for everyone who ever associated with the St. Louis Tea Party Coalition. Your own Dottie Bailey was sworn in as Representative of the 110th State House district of Eureka, Wildwood, and Pacific. 

Congratulations, Dottie.

But more than congratulations, thank you. 

On behalf of more than 10,000 active Tea Partiers in the St. Louis area, the 20,000 people who have signed up for one of another St. Louis Tea Party events, websites, mailing lists, or social media pates, thank you. 

February 27 will be the 10th anniversary of that first event, haphazardly named The National Chicago Tea Party Rally. After the success of those rallies, held in over 50 cities including St. Louis, leader Michael Patrick Leahy laid out a plan for the movement that culminated with the takeover of Congress and many state legislatures in 2010. You probably remember the historical realignment that you helped bring about. 

While the rallies and protests have faded somewhat, the commitment to liberty has not. Dottie Bailey's service to the cause of liberty, to carry on the Tea Party movement in the Missouri House is testimony to your commitment, begun in 2009 and alive today as Donald Trump stands before his enemies saying "a wall or we walk."

Thank you, Dottie, for serving us as our own wall-defender in Jefferson City. May God bless your efforts and smile on your every decision.
