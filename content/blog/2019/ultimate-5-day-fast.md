People keep asking me about my weird asceticism tricks. So I thought I'd write a short blog about them. I'm also thinking about writing a book about this stuff. Leave a comment if you'd consider reading a book that might help you live disease-free, mobile, happy, and productive right to the end. 

### What Is 'Asceticism?'

According to New Advent's Catholic Encyclopedia:

> The word asceticism comes from the Greek askesis which means practice, bodily exercise, and more especially, athletic training. The early Christians adopted it to signify the practice of the spiritual things, or spiritual exercises performed for the purpose of acquiring the habits of virtue. At present it is not infrequently employed in an opprobrious sense, to designate the religious practices of oriental fanatics as well as those of the Christian saint, both of whom are by some placed in the same category. It is not uncommonly confounded with austerity, even by Catholics, but incorrectly. For although the flesh is continuously lusting against the spirit, and repression and self-denial are necessary to control the animal passions, it would be an error to measure a man's virtue by the extent and character of his bodily penances. 

Asceticism means denying the body of things the body wants but doesn't need. And imposing on the body things the body needs but the brain doesn't want. 

For example, the body wants but doesn't need:

- Sugar
- Grains
- Comfort
- Sitting for long stretches
- Hot baths and showers
- Six or more meals a day
- Mindless entertainment

And the body needs but doesn't want:

- Strenuous exercise
- Weight lifting
- Calorie restriction
- Fasting 
- Mental challenges
- Cold showers and ice baths
- Focused contemplation

All of these things are good for body, mind, and spirit, but asceticism is primarily religious. Properly employed, asceticism involves Christian living. But cautiously. Asceticism is not self-flaggelation. It's simply denial of the body's unnecessary preferences *most* of the time. 

If you regularly deny yourself sugar (chocolate chip cookies) and grains (your favorite pizza), imagine how wonderful those things taste when you eat them? But if you ate them every day, they would soon be like air to. You wouldn't even notice they're there, would you?

And if you eat delicious, hot-from-the-oven chocolate chip cookies every day, you will be devastated if one day you are denied them. What's worse, eating those chocolaty temptations every day will put on the fast track to diseases that will require you to give up chocolate cookies forever. Diabetes being the most obvious, but fatty liver disease, arthritis, heart disease, and cancer are also associated with diets rich in grains and sugars. 

Asceticism shows respect for the body God gave you by exercising dominion over it.
