The abortion company fires its CEOs as sloppily as it delivers "healthcare." 

Before that, the Trump Administration successfully cut some of Planned Parenthood's federal funding, which may have precipitated the decapitation of its management team. 

And, today, Planned Parenthood's hand-picked judge tentatively ruled in complete favor with the journalist the company is suing. 

### Aborting Dr. Wen

On Wednesday, Planned Parenthood clumsily fired Dr. Leana Wen as its chief executive. I guess you could call it a late-term firing, since Dr. Wen was in her eighth month of presidency. Various insider blame Dr. Wen's emphasis on things other than abortion (like Pap Smears and breast cancer screenings). Via [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/us/politics/planned-parenthood-wen.html):

> Current and former Planned Parenthood officials describe Dr. Wen as a smart but alienating manager who wanted to significantly reorient the group’s focus away from the abortion wars and more toward its role as a women’s health provider.

Soon, the organization founded to exterminate undesirables, like blacks and Irish, will have its third head in nine months. That's a recipe for weak fundraising and confused messaging.

But Dr. Wen's departure is only part of their problems.

### Kiss $260 Million a Year Goodbye

Before Dr. Wen was sucked out of the room, The White House announced it was enforcing an existing rule that prohibits funding for abortion referrals. The $260 million loss was described by Planned Parenthood as "a devastating blow."

Were this defunding move an isolated incident, the abortion-mongers might not be so upset. But this is just a latest in a series of pro-life moves by the most pro-life US president in history. (No, Reagan had nothing on Donald Trump in the pro-life department.) Here's a sample of President's Trump's pro-life actions:

1. Appointment of 160 pro-life federal judges and Supreme Court justices.
2. Permitting states to defund Planned Parenthood of Title X funding.
3. Stopped tax dollars from going to overseas abortion providers.
4. Defunded the pro-abortion UNFPA.
5. Required insurance companies to disclose if plans cover abortions.
6. Rolled back Obama-era relaxations of federal abortion rules.
7. Filled his cabinet and executive branch offices with pro-life leaders.
8. Create the Office for Conscience Protection at HHS.
9. Allowed States to Defund Planned Parenthood of Medicaid Funds.
10. Cut Planned Parenthood’s Tax Funding by up to $60 Million.
11. Canceled Huge Contract for Taxpayer-Funded Experimentation with Body Parts of Aborted Babies.

Just two-and-a-half years into [an eight-year administration](https://www.hennessysview.com/posts/2019/2019-07-17-yes-president-trump-will-win-re-election/), President Trump is on track to be the president who finally ends America's sick fascination with infanticide.

And, to make matters worse for the left, even their own judges are turning against Planned Parenthood.

### Journalism Wins

In San Francisco, a liberal federal judge instructed both parties to treat an interim decision as final. The order is from the case brought by Planned Parenthood against citizen-journalist David Daleiden. Daleiden caught on camera Planned Parenthood doctors offering to sell the body parts of aborted babies on the black market. 

Planned Parenthood sued Daleiden on the grounds that his expose was intended to incite violence against the organization and its employees and victims. 

But the judge seems inclined to toss the case:

> In his tentative ruling, which he instructed the parties to treat as if it were substantially final, 
>
> **Judge William Orrick III rejected Planned Parenthood’s false and long-running smear that accused CMP citizen journalists, including David Daleiden,**
>
>  of attempting to incite “threats” and “violence” by publishing the undercover videos.

LifeNews has more:

> Judge Orrick wrote he was “inclined to exclude from the case all damages that stem from third parties’ reactions to the release of the video recordings as impermissible damages barred by the First Amendment absent a defamation claim.”Judge Orrick left in place only “damages for investigating intrusions” into Planned Parenthood’s space, and “improvements to access-security measures for conferences and facilities,” as well as nominal and statutory damages.

Judge Orrick, by the way, has a history of donating to and promoting Planned Parenthood. Even a hand-picked judge seems to realize just how evil the organization is.

### Praise God

All of this is sign that the prayers are working. As St. Padre Pio called the Rosary a most-powerful weapon in the war against Satan. Planned Parenthood is Satan's church. If you want to destroy Satan's church, pray the Rosary every day. 

This week's headlines tell me that a lot of people are saying the daily Rosary. The good guys are making a comeback. Planned Parenthood is in retreat. And it's all the result of our cooperation with God's plan.
