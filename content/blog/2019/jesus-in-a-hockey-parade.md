I'm taking a risk here. The chance of running afoul of orthodoxy is high. But I haven't written in a while, and I haven't written about the Blues winning the Stanley Cup. So, here goes.

My son Patrick and I were lucky enough to:

1. attend Game 4, 
2. be together for games 5, 6, and 7, and 
3. arrive at O.B. Clark's at 4:30 p.m. the day after we won the Cup.

Now, you have to remember that my boys were raised with house rules like:

1. Hockey uniform tops are called "sweaters," not "jerseys."
2. The Blue note never touches the ground.
3. You wear the Blues sweater when watching a game on TV, even in October.
4. Baseball season begins when the Blues have been eliminated. Never earlier.

So, watching Sammy Blais demanding cheers from the drunks in the parking lot and watching "wild man" Colton Parakyo lead cheers by slinging the Cup dangerously over the rail of O.B. Clark's deck was like heaven for us. Patrick got to lay hands on the Cup in that parking lot. I think Joel Edmundson was carrying it, but Jordan Binnington was in the area, too. 

Then we watched THE PARADE on TV (and on Twitter, where the best video appeared). My liver couldn't handle another round of day-drinking, and Patrick had to be at a wedding in the afternoon. We couldn't go downtown. We didn't need to. It was somebody else's turn. 

Almost everyone I talked to had one favorite observation about the post-Cup behavior of the Blues. (Well, two favorite observations, if you count their drinking). Everyone seemed to appreciate . . . no, appreciate is too weak. Everyone seemed _adore_ the way the Blues abandonded their pedestals to party with the people. 

Who can forget the image of Colton Parayko catching a 16-ounce Bud Light whilst standing in his parade car, belting out a loud, open-mouthed yell, ripping off the cap, and guzzling the brew before hopping off the car, snatching a toddler from his parents, throwing the kid onto his shoulders like he was in a squat rack, and running down the police line high-fiving everything in his path? 

Was this behavior by the Blues players unusual? 

Maybe not for hockey champions, but for St. Louis champions, yes.

Even the most rabid Cardinal baseball fans admit the Cardinals never dove the crowd after 2006 or 2011 the way the Blues did after 2019. And they probably never will. 

But this isn't about hockey players vs. baseball players. This is about how you can see the remarkable humility of Jesus Christ reflected in the way the Blues shared the Cup with people who can't even skate. 


On an infinitely smaller scalre, the St. Louis Blues _condescended_ to become fans. They _acted_ like fans in the days following their Cup win. They _became_ fans for a time. They shared in the _suffering_of the fans. They donned our costumes and, in so doing, they stole our hearts in a way they couldn't even by winning the Stanley Cup. 

But if we love the Blues because they drank beer with us, how much more must we love Christ who died like us? Died the most torturous death devised by the most creatively torturous culture in history? 

And Christ could not have suffered a death by humiliation and torture if hadn't first _condescended_ to become _one of us!_ If you're the second person of Almighty God, there are only two excuses for stooping so low as to become a man: 1) insanity; 2) supernatural love for your creation. 

I believe God gives us natural but inadequate analogies to His love for us. He gives us the love of a spouse, the love of a child, the love of a faithful dog. In each of these loves, we feel the Holy Spirit, but these natural loves are still inadequate. They are mere glimpses of God's infinite love. And they are each finite. These earthly loves are limited. They will end when our earthly lives end. 

So, the Blues got out of their cars. Jordan Binnington played about a dozen instruments with the Oakville High School marching band. Ryan O'Reilly stole a police bicycle. They acted like us. 

Jesus Christ, God, became one of us, taught us how to live perfectly, died for us and by us, rose from the dead, and opened the gates of eternity to us. 

This does nothing to dimish the way the Blues drew us into their world and enter into ours. I still cry in appreciation for their unbelievable and unprecedented humility. No, I'm not understanding what the Blues did. I'm pointing out that what He did was infinitely more impressive. 

The next time I stand and cheer wildly for a minute when Tom Calhoun introduces "your Saint Louis Bluuuuuuuues," I hope I remember that Christ Jesus deserves a standing ovation that lasts forever. Secula seculorum.
