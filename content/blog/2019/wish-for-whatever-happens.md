> Let me die to myself and live in You.
Let me accept whatever happens as from You.
- From St. Augustine's Petition

Frustration is the difference between our expectations and reality. 

Every day, the culture teaches us to expect more and better, but reality trudges on apace, give us less and worse. Thus, frustration increases every day. 

When we talk about the widening division in the country, we are really talking about frustration. Those other people don't think or behave as we expect everyone to think or before, therefore, we feel frustrated. 

Frustration over a long period of time turns to anger. Frustration caused by other people's believes turns to hatred. Eventually, the only solution to our frustration *cum* fury is to eliminate the source of our frustration: those other people. 

If we eliminate a few of them (or they eliminate a few of us), it's called murder. If we (or they) eliminate more than a few of them (or us), it's called terrorism. If we eliminate a whole bunch of each other, it's called civil war. And civil wars often begin with a murder or two that escalate into terrorism and culminate in all out war. 

We are on the path to civil war. I'm telling you now, there is not a single example in history of a nation as divided as ours that did not move to civil war. I'm just telling you how it is. 

But I'm going beyond just telling you how it is. I'm going to tell you how to find happiness and satisfaction *even if* you live the rest of your life in a nation at war with itself. And the solution is over 2,000 years old and it's available to you right this minute. You don't have to buy a book or attend a class or watch a video. In fact, you don't even have to finish reading this post. I'll give you the secret right now. 

If you want to be happy no matter what happens, good or ill, wish for whatever happens. 

Think that's impossible? Think it's Pollyannaish Christian nonsense?

I first came across this little life lesson, not in Christian literatrue, but in ancient Greek and Roman philosophy. From the philosophy of Stoicism (which means "the porch"). In particular, the concept comes from Rufus. 

> In the year 62, when Plautus learned that Nero had pronounced his death sentence, he turned to his friend Musonius for advice on whether to fight or to flee. Musonius advised neither course and counseled his friend against living his last days in anxiety. He gave him the Stoic advice that death is only an apparent evil, and maintaining dignity and virtue while still alive is what is truly good. Plautus did not resist the arrival of the centurion who would carry his head back to Nero at Rome.
