Peak Stupidity

We all know Democrats.

We like them personally. 

We hate when they talk politics. 

Which they do.

Often.

Too often.

Because it makes us like them less. 

When Democrat friends talk politics, we pity their ignorance. Their bigotry. Their stupidity.

Democrats are stupid. 

Very stupid. And ignorant. 

They aren't smart people. They aren't informed people. They aren't noble people. 

They're stupid. 

Really stupid. 

Slow. Stupid. Bigoted.

### But Not For Long

The good news is: we've reached Peak Stupidity. 

Democrats can't get more stupid than they got this week. If they got more stupid, Democrats' hearts would stop beating. A body needs a brain. And Democrats are approaching brainless.

And I can prove it.

Today, the House Judiciary Committee approved two articles of impeachment. 

1. Abuse of power (which isn't a law)
2. Obstruction of Congress (which is a virtue)

They justified these articles by claiming:

1. The president colluded with Russia in 2016
2. The president colluded with mighty Ukraine in 2019

Did you catch the stupidity?

If the high crimes and misdemeanors were collusion (which isn't a crime) with foreign governments, the articles of impeachment would be:

1. Collusion with Russia
2. Collusion with Ukraine

But the articles of impeachment are the work of stupid people:

1. Acting like a boss
2. Acting like a president
