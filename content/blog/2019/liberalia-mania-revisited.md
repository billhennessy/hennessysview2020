William F. Buckley Jr. defined "liberal mania" in is book *Up From Liberalism.*

> I shall be assuming that in most respects the Liberal ideologists are, like Don Quixote, wholly normal, with fully developed powers of thought, that they see things as they are, and live their lives according to the Word; but that, like Don Quixote, whenever anything touches upon their mania, they become irresponsible. Don Quixote’s mania was knight-errantry. The Liberal’s mania is their Ideology. Deal lightly with any precept of knight-errantry, and you might find, as so many innocent Spaniards did, the Terror of La Mancha hurtling toward you. Cross a Liberal on duty, and he becomes a man of hurtling irrationality.<sup>1</sup>

What a perfect description of the left's reaction to new pro-life laws in Missouri, Alabama, Georgia, and elsewhere. Courageous legislators in those and other states have, indeed, touched upon their mania and triggered their irresponsibility. 

When Buckley wrote the book in 1959, he probably couldn't have foreseen the Supreme's Court's ultimate act of legislating from the bench which was then fourteen years *prepartum*. Nor could he have foreseen that the liberals of his day would be conservative fellow-travellers in 2019. The liberals of 1959 are with us, now, and have been replaced by an angry, militant, and ill-educated progressive left. And this new left's mania makes the old liberal mania look downright responsible and reasoned.
