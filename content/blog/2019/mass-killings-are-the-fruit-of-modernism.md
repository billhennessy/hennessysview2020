Simple minds seek simple answers. 

A man kills innocents with a gun, and the simple mind blames the gun. When a dog sees an approaching shadow, he attacks his tail. 

### Mass Killings Are Modernism In Action

Modernism leads us to simple, but wrong, answers. Modernists have one solution for all problems: consolidate all freedom, all power, all decisions, all goods, all authority, and all thinking into the hands of a few omnipotent men. Give these elite men the power to crush men who step out of line. Remove from the masses any way to resist. 

The Modernist's solution has a name: slavery. 

But the Modernists are now, always have been, and always will be wrong. Dead wrong. The modernists would replace God with government. And the result is always the same:

- Nazi Germany
- The Soviet Union
- Mao's China
- Catro's Cuba
- Tito's Yugoslavia
- Maduro's Venezuela
- America's Planned Parenthood

The Modernist's solution to all social problems is murder on a mass scale, but sanctioned. The Modernist consolidates the power and authority to murder in the hands of the government.

And, yet, it is not this consolidation of power that threatens the life, liberty, and property of man. Rather, it is the rejection of God. 

Yesterday, we were reminded, once again, that **there is no life, no peace, no safety outside of Christ and His Church**. 

Someone pointed out on Twitter that semi-automatic guns have been around in large numbers for 100 years, yet frequent mass shootings are something new. 

He's right. Weapons haven't changed: people have. 

### _Your_ Truth Is a Lie 

America is accurately called a post-Christian culture. A culture where the person is the supreme being. And the individual is at the pinnacle of the hierarchy of creatures. Every man is a god. All powerful. All knowing. 

In this Godless culture, eternity is a myth. Therefore, each man-god's duty is to enjoy this life to the fullest. If you're a man who thinks pretending to be a woman is a requirement to your pleasure, then every knee must bend when you don a dress. If you're a woman who thinks the child in your womb must die for you to experience pleasure in this life, then suck it out, grind it up, and sell the parts for scientific experimentation. 

Is it any wonder that one of these man-gods decides people shopping in Walmart are a hindrance to his happiness that he would hesitate to annihilate them? 

And by whose authority can we these actions are wrong? Not by man's authority. Every man's opinion is equal. We each have our own truth, do we not? We are told to live our truth. 

But truths collide. 

There is only one authority and that is God Almighty. There is only one judge of man, and that His Son, our Lord, Jesus Christ.   When we reject God's authority, we submit to Satan's. 

[Choose your lord and master well](https://www.hennessysview.com/2018/08/08/crawling-back-to-happiness-and-freedom/).

If everyone surrendered his will to God, we could give every human being an arsenal of nuclear weapons and feel perpetually safe. If each human being is his own god omnipotent, we could destroy every weapon down to the spear and never experience a moment's peace. 

If you want to stop mass killings, get to Mass. Get down on your knees and give to God what is God's, which is all your thoughts, all your wants, all your possessions, all your sufferings, all your joys, and, indeed, all your life. 

Do not wait for others to go first. That's Satan's game. "Fairness." 

Defy Satan. 

I try to live this simple prayer of St. Ignatius of Loyola. I fail many times every day. But God forgives. And God gives us the graces to try again. 

### Suscipe

> Take, Lord, and receive all my liberty, my memory, my understanding, and my entire will, all I have and call my own.

> You have given all to me. To you, Lord, I return it.

> Everything is yours; do with it what you will. Give me only your love and your grace, that is enough for me.

### Modernism Is Satan's Tool

Modernists _hate_ this prayer, because Satan _hates_ this prayer. We cannot break Satan's grasp, but God can. And God will when we recognize—and _only_ when we recognize—that everything is His, including our bodies, our minds, our liberty, our memories, our children, our lives. 

Mass murders are signs of America's submission to and cooperation with Satan. Try any solution but complete attachment to and cooperation with God, and you will be culpable of the next mass murder. 

You, I, Donald Trump, and all 20 Democrat candidates for president are equally _powerless_ to stop mass murders. Only when America reverts to Christ will these evil acts decline.
