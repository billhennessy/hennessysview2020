Bishop Barron is a pioneer of new media. His ministry, Word on Fire, manages to reach people who would otherwise never hear Catholic evangelism. For that, we tip our cap to the Bishop. 

Bishop Barron is very sensitive to cultural influences on people. He understands that every message from politics, movies, magazines, self-help gurus, and even some churches exhort people to live their lives like this is all there is. Hedonism run amok. Feelings over substance. Comfort and liesure are your only missions. 

He's right. Our culture is preoccupied with softness. Softness, weakness, and self-truth have become the aims of American society. No honor or achievement, just nothingness.

So how does a bishop of the Catholic Church, a church built on the blood of martyrs, break through to people raised this way? People for whom driving to Taco Bell is too big an ordeal, so they order their Mexican Pizzas through Grub Hub? 

Bishop Barron prefers a soft approach, meeting the culture where it is. Hypnosists and persuasion experts call this technique "pace and lead." First, you pace the subject, building rapport, highlighting similarities. Then, you lead. People are more likely to imitate others who are similar to them. Identity is a powerful persuasion tool.

That's Bishop Barron's game: pace and lead. It's a good strategy. 

How good, we don't know. I have no statistics on the number of people who've become Catholic after exposure to Bishop Barron. And that would be only a correlation. I'm not sure it's possible to prove that someone became Catholic *because* of Bishop Barron. But let's assume someone has been received into the Church, and the person credits Bishop Barron for his conversion. Let's even say "many have been saved" through Bishop Barron's apostelate.  

Once brought into the church, what's next? What kind of Catholic do they become? Do they continue to imitate Bishop Barron, or do they move beyond him to a deeper, tougher faith?

Last week, Bishop Barron had the honor of saying the opening prayer for Congress. He decided to leave Catholicism out of his prayer and present an ecumenical face. His prayer lacked any hint of Church tradition. It could have been offered by any Protestant, Jew, or even Muslim.

> O God, Source of all justice, You have summoned everyone who works in this chamber to walk the path of righteousness, to foster life and liberty, to care especially for the poorest and most vulnerable in our society. Free these servants of yours O Lord, of all those attachments to wealth or power or privilege or fame that would prevent them from following the course You have set out for them. Make them mindful of the time when they first heard your voice and followed it with idealism and enthusiasm.

He began by saying "Let us pray." 

He did not make the sign of the cross. He did not pray in Jesus' name.

Was this some great sin? Probably not. Did he do or saying anything that would turn anyone off? Only those who hate God. (But, at least, he offende them.) But he left so much on the table.

I disagree with those who say the bishop should have stormed and pronounced them all heathens. That would have done no good. But I cannot understand why he would pretend he isn't a Catholic bishop. Why seem ashamed of the traditions of your faith? 

Most adults realize that Catholics make the sign of the cross to open and close prayers. We do this to remind ourselves of the Holy Trinity, to order our consciousness toward that end, and to remember that Christ died for our sins. 

> "In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit." 

If you came to the faith by way of Bishop Barron, is that where your formation stopped, too? Do you believe it's okay to do all the Catholic things in a church, but before Congress you pretend you're nondenominational? And not even a nondenominational Christian, but just a nondenomination person who believes in God? 

Bishop Barron has said that he laments the new and growing traditional movement in the Church. He believes the Church before Vatican II was wrong about almost everything. He
