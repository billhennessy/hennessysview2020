This is a challenge. 

 

I want you to grab a pen and paper (or open your favorite note app). Now write down a list of characteristic you’d expect a **superhero_ _**to display. Write as many or as few as you’d like.

 

Don’t continue until you’ve written down the characteristics of a superhero.

**Welcome back.**

 

Here’s the next step. I want you to look over your list of superhero traits. As you do, **think about the amount of that trait you have in you**. 

 

Make 0 through 5 scale, if you’d like, and give yourself a grade for each trait. (Use a zero-based scale if you do, though. You probably don’t have x-ray vision or eyeballs on your fingertips. Those traits would be zero on any scale.)

 

I’ll bet you have at least some level of one or more superhero traits, don’t you? 

 

**That means you can be a superhero. A real superhero. They’ll make a movie about you someday. **

 

But they won’t make a movie unless you use your superpower for good.

 

So you have one more task.

 

**Write down how you will use your superpower _today_ to help preserve our republic**. Write down only one, measurable, certain action you will do today that involves your superpower. 

 

Then go do it.

 

That’s it. 

 

BONUS: **Tell us what your superpower is and how you used it today in the comments below**.
