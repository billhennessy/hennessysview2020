What I find so funny about [Claire McCaskill's war on super pacs](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/sen-claire-mccaskill-takes-fight-to-super-pacs-as-missouri-swings-farther-right/2012/04/22/gIQAqoAmaT_story.html) is that her husband _is_ a super PAC.

For the record, I have formally endorsed Senator McCaskill in her race to return to private life.


### Zimmerman Update


Having declared George Zimmerman guilty of first degree, racially motivated murder, the MSM are now investigating the case.

What they're finding:


> The George Zimmerman that Francescani describes is quite different from the "delusional racist vigilante" that many have made him out to be.

Conservatives didn't pre-judge Zimmerman the way liberals did.  Maybe because studies show we are


> better informed, more intellectually consistent, more open-minded, more empathetic and more receptive to criticism than their fellow Americans who support the Democratic Party.

(BTW, narrow-minded liberals _hate it_ when you remind them that they're narrow-minded, uninformed, and less receptive to criticism. So don't do that.)


### So, to mayor. Or Sotomayor


Being the eternal optimist, I'm holding out hope that Sonia Sotomayor could flip right one day.  On Wednesday, my silly dream got a bump.

The Supreme Court heard arguments in Obama vs. The People of Arizona.  (I know that's not the actual caption, but it should be.) Justice [Sotomayor "shredded" the U.S. government's crappy case, in Business Insider's view](https://www.businessinsider.com/arizona-immigration-law-arguments-shredded-even-by-liberal-justices-2012-4).  Quoting Sotomayor:


> Putting aside your argument that this -- that a systematic cooperation is wrong -- **you can see it's not selling very well -- why don't you try to come up with something else? [emphasis original].**


**
**On her first day on the court, she questioned whether corporations really should have the same rights as humans who never die.  For many libertarians, that's a question worth exploring.   (But that's a huge conversation for another day.)

Exit question: ** has Donald Verrilli argued his last case before the Supreme Court?**   I can't imagine that Obama will accept the blame for[ giving Verrilli impossible assignments in this and Obamacare cases](https://hennessysview.com/2012/03/27/why-people-are-being-unfair-to-donal-verrilli/).

Maybe the real reason [Obama wants more illegals in the U.S. is to stuff ballot boxes in November](https://hennessysview.com/2012/04/22/democrats-committed-massive-vote-fraud-in-2008-theyll-do-it-again-in-2012-and-few-people-care/).
