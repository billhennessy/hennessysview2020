I'm interesting in a few things about candidates. Â If you are a candidate for the Missouri legislature or for statewide office, I invite you [take this short questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGNVSWtGazNOTmJUcHlncFBoMkZqLVE6MQ#gid=0).

I will post results before the August 7 primary.

Please note that I do not intend to base my vote solely on your answers to these questions.
