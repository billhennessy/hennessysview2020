St. Louis's KSDK.com is doing its fair share to suppress the Republican voter turnout. They're pumping a handful of counted votes to give the impression that Obama is walking away with the national popular vote:

**Filth.**

But that doesn't stop the voter-suppression wizards at KSDK , the AP, and Politico from splattering a meaningless graph across their home pages.

(Note: Politico has since removed the misleading graphic.)

Let KSDK know you don't appreciate voter suppression tactics.

UPDATE: In response to @Michelle_Moore's watchdog journalism, the vote suppressors have update their misleading graphic.
