If you believe that 92 percent of people need to have most aspect of their lives managed by experts, then a second Obama term will make you happy.

If, however, you believe in [self-governance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-governance), that people are endowed by God and nature with the capacity and unalienable right to manage their own affairs, then a second Obama term will be a massive [human rights violation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights).

Consider what the Obama administration has already brought us:



	  * He has appointed bureaucrats to make your medical decisions
	  * He has given himself the sole authority to strike down laws passed by Congress
	  * He has taken upon himself the authority to create laws that Congress specifically refused to pass
	  * He has deployed drones to spy on Americans without a warrant
	  * He has denied private companies the permission to seek and recover fuel
	  * He has encouraged violence against the hardest working Americans
	  * He has encouraged illegal aliens to steal our things
	  * He has disparaged the Constitution as “fundamental flawed document”
	  * He has seized control of private companies
	  * He has damaged America’s credit rating
	  * He has exploited racial tension for his own advantage
	  * He has undermined small business

So, how bad would a second Obama term be?  Frankly, I think it would end the United States of America has we know it.
