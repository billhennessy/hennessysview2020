Go vote, please. Please. Vote now. Don’t Put It Off!!

 

**Did you know that ObamaCare is my fault?**

 

Of course, it is. Read my story below the clock.

**I didn’t vote in 2006. You know why? **

 

I put it off. 

 

I decided not to stop on my way to work in the morning. Why? _I’ll have plenty of time tonight, _I thought. _I’ll stop on my way home_.

 

But guess what.

 

An emergency at work. I didn’t get out until 6:30.

 

I still had time, but it was raining. And there was major construction on my default path home. And between the rain and traffic and dark and leaves, two cars collided. 

 

I got to the polling place—drove past it—at 7:18.

 

What happened?

 

Nancy Pelosi became Speaker. The economy tanked. Obamacare passed. 

 

Blame it on me. 

 

**Just don’t burden yourself with guilt like mine. **

 

Vote early. Carry out your duty. Exercise your privilege.

 

Vote.

 

**And vote for **[**Rodger Cook**](https://cookforcongress.org/)** for Congress in IL-12. **
