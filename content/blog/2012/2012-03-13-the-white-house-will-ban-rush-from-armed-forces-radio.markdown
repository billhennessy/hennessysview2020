](https://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/rush-limbaugh-white-shirt.jpg)When I was on the USS John C. Calhoun, the XO and I were big Rush fans. We stockpiled Snapple in the outboards of the Ship’s Office just to have a little taste of EIB during our three-month patrols.

 

That was 1992. Back when this country’s government still held onto some strand of connection to its founding. 

 

That's all gone, now. The United States is a shell of its former self. Not just the government, but the people, too. We’ve allowed the government to run our lives, and it has obliged. Washington now decides what we eat, what we read, what we hear, and what we say. And most of us, it seems, are fine with that.

 

It’s no surprise, then, that [the White House has agreed to ban Rush Limbaugh from Armed Forces Radio](https://www.examiner.com/conservative-in-spokane/white-house-petition-calls-for-removal-of-rush-limbaugh-from-armed-forces-radio) upon receipt of few more complaints.

 

Nothing scientific. Nothing’s stopping someone from filling hundreds of complaints a day. The number of petition signatures Obama demands is as significant as the popular vote count in Leonid Brezhnev's final unanimous election. 

 

Breitbart, who said “we need Rush,” is gone. Rush, it seems, is going down without much of a fight from his listeners. (Have you sold your Ford, Toyota, or Chevy? Banned McDonald’s? Donated your Select Comfort bed?)

 

If Rush goes down, who will be able to stand in the wind that howls from Washington? 

 

Time is running short, folks. The drones are in the air. The White House has given itself sole and unquestionable authority to kill any American it determines needs to die. Obama has no intention of losing this election.

 

[Joe Newby says the Democrats’ plan to destroy Rush will backfire](https://www.examiner.com/conservative-in-spokane/why-the-left-s-war-on-rush-limbaugh-and-free-speech-will-backfire?CID=obinsite). Do you buy that? Or do you expect the right to lose its most effective voice over the past quarter century?
