Barack Obama ridiculed George W. Bush for Katrina.

As people starve and beg for water in Rockaways, Obama’s promises to create heaven on earth through government look foolish and born of ignorance. 

Obama believes that government can solve any problem, large or small. [But his FEMA can’t get water to people in New York City](https://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2012/11/02/FEMA-Still-Doesn-t-Have-Bottled-Water-to-Distribute-Finally-Places-Large-Order-Today-for-Delivery-Monday). 

With election two days away, remember this, you Obama voters: [the most activist president of all time was unable to feed, clothe, and house hurricane victims despite having a week of warning](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/nov/3/obama-gets-briefing-storm-recovery/). 

[Government has its limits](https://www.presstv.ir/usdetail/270139.html), but it will never limit its own thirst for power. You have to do that. And if you don’t put down the monster at the ballot box, it will put you down in a pine box.
