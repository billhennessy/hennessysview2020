The problem is, like many economists,** Florida’s understanding of home ownership is 180 degrees ass-backwards**.  Florida thinks that home ownership is supposed to _cause_ economic growth.

No, professor.  **Home ownership is the _reward_ for economic growth in healthy systems**.  In the 1990s and 2000s, however, government mandates more or less forced people to buy homes and forced banks to lend to anyone.  That drove up the home ownership percentage without the organic economic growth to justify it.

Now if you’d help us get government and crony big bankers out of the way, we’ll restore housing equilibrium and a vibrant economy in no time.
