For years voters have complained that politicians and parties say anything to get a vote. People have longed for the days of plain talk and honesty.

](https://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/planetoftheapesending.jpg)Well, the Democrats passed a new platform today. Two headlines emerged:

1. The Democrats rejected any reference to God.

2. The Democrats rejected Jerusalem as Israel's capital.

The question is: can you trust them? Do Democrats really reject God and reject Jerusalem as the center of Israeli political life?

If they're pandering, to whom are the Democrats pandering?

Not to people of faith, of course.  And they're not pandering to Israel or to Jews. It seems the Democrats have rejected the blue collar independents. They've rejected the middle class. They've repudiated the American ideal. They've walked away from Western Civilization.

The only conclusion a rational mind can reach is that the Democrats have endorsed the Third World. And they've endorsed it, not as a focus for our charity to raise it up. The Democrats view the Third World as the STANDARD to which America and Western Civilization must be lowered.

The answer to my question is "Yes!"  Yes, we can trust Barack Obama and his Democratic party in their rejection of God and Israel.
