Two weeks ago, weeks ago, how many Missouri statewide offices did you expect to flip?  Be honest.

Yes, there are great people running for Governor, Secretary of State, and Treasurer.  And we already have a fine Lieutenant Governor Kinder running for re-election.

But numerous factors, like name recognition, experience, and Jay Nixon’s weird relationship with Republican House leadership, made a major upset unlikely. And no Republicans had stepped up to challenge Chris Koster for Attorney General.

**Until **[Ed Martin](https://edmartinformissouri.com/)****** jumped into AG race yesterday. **

Now, we have a fight.

Ed’s statewide name recognition, familiarity with Jefferson City, and enormous respect among grass roots put every statewide office immediately in play.

But every race will be a dogfight.  Every race will be bruising.  Every candidate will need every possible vote.

That’s why I’m thrilled, giddy, jubilant, proud, and _pantingly pleased_ that the [St. Louis Tea Party Coalition](https://stlouisteaparty.com) has joined the nationwide [Election Day Tea Party](https://www.electiondayteaparty.com).

And** I’m more thrilled, giddy, etc. that we’re kicking off election season with the 3rd Anniversary Tea Party PLUS 7 Events That Made America America with Dr. Larry Schweikart.  **

Friday is Dr. Schweikart, author of _A Patriot’s History of the United States_.  Larry puts on one hell of a show.  We’ll provde hors d’oeuvres, a free drink, a cash bar, and an After Party.

**Saturday is a full day of getting down and dirty with winning some friggin’ elections**.  We’ll have training from local and national experts, inspirational talks from Bill Federer and Dr. Schweikart, caucus training, social media training for beginners and experts, and more. We’ve taken care of breakfast AND lunch, so you can focus on the fight.

**With four statewide offices now totally in play, we all need to arm our minds with the most important facts to win in 2012.  But wait; there’s more!**

In St. Louis’s reconstituted 1st US Congressional District, **[the indefatigable Martin Baker](https://martinbakerforcongress.com/)** has a chance to flip a seat that’s been Democrat since the destruction of federalism was only gleam in FDR’s eye.

**Plus, we have a Saul Alinsky socialist to evict from the White House!**

Please get your tickets now. Tickets for Friday’s event are going very fast, and Saturday’s moving, too.  Once they’re gone, they’re gone—we don’t have room for more.

Remember, Friday and Saturday, February 24 and 25 at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Clayton, MO.  Get your tickets here, today.
