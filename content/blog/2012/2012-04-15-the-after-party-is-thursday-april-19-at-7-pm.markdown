The After Party is Thursday, April 19, at 7 pm.  The location is Crowne Plaza Hotel in Clayton.

The subject is the corrupt and corrupting judge selection process in Missouri, and how you can help change it.   [I learned a lot about the subject when Ed Martin pointed out this National Review article on the subject](https://www.nationalreview.com/bench-memos/295813/other-news-missouri-trial-lawyers-still-strong-carrie-severino).


> The structure and left-wing dominance of the nominating commission (the distinctive feature of the Missouri Plan) has led many to argue that the state should amend the constitution to either directly elect judges or have them selected under something mirroring the advice/consent model set forth in the U.S. Constitution.


(BTW, [Missouri's courts could also use a true conservative Attorney General, hint-hint](https://edmartinformissouri.com/).)

See you Thursday!
