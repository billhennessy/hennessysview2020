###### Note:  This is a flight of fantasy. If anything in this post is later shown to conform reality, it’s pure coincidence.  Nor am I accusing Gen. Petraeus of any crime or of compromising of national security secrets. (Just enjoy it, will ya?)


A sex scandal rocks the king of spies.

An email chain unravels the Pentagon high command.

A cover-up exposed.

It's like the back cover of a Nelson DeMille novel.

Generals don’t forget they’re soldiers just because they crawl behind a desk.

Soldiers look out for each other.

General David Petrraeus’s nature is to have the back of every American in uniform. And every American assigned to some shit-hole consulate representing the USA.

**When people under a general’s command die, the general dies a little with them**. Maybe that’s why a fender-bender killed Patton at the end of WWII. He’d already absorbed a lot of blows by proxy.

**So imagine David Petraeus’s fury at the Obama Administration’s handling of the Benghazi massacre**. Good men left to die while the President raised money for his re-election.

Then the President’s people go on TV to blame to the CIA for the debacle.

“The f***ing gall!”

As pressure mounts from non-MSM journalists, and the White House continues to lie and stonewall, General Petraeus has had it. On October 26, [Petraeus throws Obama under the bus](https://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/petraeus-throws-obama-under-bus_657896.html) by flatly contradicting Obama’s claim that the CIA gave the order to stand down in Benghazi.

_Repercussions?_  he thinks. _Who cares. The Commander in Chief failed in his most basic duty, and the press is letting  him walk._

The media and Congressional Democrats didn’t give a damn about a few lives in Benghazi.  And there’s no way to get their attention on the matter. Even if Petraeus quit and shouted “cover-up” from the highest mountain, Brian Williams’s head is too far up Obama’s ass to hear a pound of C4 detonating 5 feet away.

### And then comes the lady trouble.


Petraeus is smart enough to know that sex sells newspapers. And TV ads. Wrap a national security story inside a torrid affair with a ex-military hottie and a [Tampa Troop Groupie](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=9&cad=rja&ved=0CGoQFjAI&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Fstory%2Fnews%2Fnation%2F2012%2F11%2F13%2Fpetraeus-jill-kelley-broadwell-allen%2F1703097%2F&ei=kfmiUKPHKISgyAHjvoGgDw&usg=AFQjCNEnHowj9cQI00m0T6-SvcSa3EXhCA&sig2=5_1AWmYLfG20hun3tw8bxA) and everybody suddenly knows everything about everything.

He knows that he and West Point graduate Paula Broadwell are going down at some point. Why not take the White House down with them?

So the general makes sure the mistress knows just enough about the Benghazi fiasco to rock the White House, but not enough to compromise sources, methods, or operations.

(There _IS_ a new James Bond movie out, ya know.)

Tonight the FBI raided Broadwell’s house. They’re confiscating papers and computers—anything with a magnetic disk or SSD. They’re looking for classified information that Paula shouldn’t have.

Fox News reports that on October 26—the same day Patraeus contradicted the White House about Benghazi—[Paula Broadwell may have included classified information about the attack in a speech in Colorado](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/11/12/petraeus-mistress-may-have-revealed-classified-information-at-denver-speech/).

The White House, eager to destroy Petraeus, will leak all the nasty spy stuff they find on the little lady’s hard drives. Andrea Mitchell will breathlessly read the “secret” memos about that horrible night in September. Americans who through "Ben Ghazi" was a kid they sat begin in second grade, will learn all about the #7HoursOfHell.

(Did you know that [Petraeus conducted his own investigation of Benghazi ](https://hotair.com/archives/2012/11/13/abc-petraeus-conducted-investigation-in-benghazi-after-attack/)last month?)


### Could It Be?


Could David Petraeus and Paula Broadwell have thrown themselves on a grenade to get the word out about Benghazi?

Regardless, Patraeus is ruined. But if this case ended as a complicated act of defiance over Benghazi, this affair could be his finest hour.

After all,** they’re reporting on Benghazi now, aren't they?**
