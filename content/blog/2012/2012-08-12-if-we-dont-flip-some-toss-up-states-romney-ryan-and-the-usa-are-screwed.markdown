Choosing Paul Ryan as his running mate was a great Romney move. Looking ahead, Romney sees movement conservatives working hard right up to the election—even if he or his advisors continues to say stupid things.  That was necessary.

But it wasn’t enough to win the election and unseat America’s first anti-American president.  To do that, we must find a way to win over the selfish middle. (I know, writing things like “selfish middle” doesn’t help, but I hate lying to them.)

Here’s the reality: the Electoral College, which once favored Republicans, is now the exclusive property of the DNC.  That’s because “moderates,” who vote for candidates promising to give them stuff, have moved into formerly conservative states.  In the map above, Obama needs only 33 electoral votes to win.

Now, take out all the toss-ups by giving the gray states to the candidate currently with the lead in polls in that state:

If the election were held today, America would be screwed.

It’s possible, perhaps likely, that **Romney could win a sizable popular majority and STILL lose an Electoral landslide**.

Here’s what we need to do if we don’t want to be the generation that lost America:



	  1. Shore up Romney’s lead in the red states like Missouri
	  2. Sweep statewide races in red states like Missouri
	  3. Ensure a Republican Congress (both houses)
	  4. Adopt a toss-up state to work

Here are the toss-up states (electoral votes):

	  * Colorado (9)
	  * Florida (29)
	  * Iowa (6)
	  * Nevada (6)
	  * New Hampshire (4)
	  * North Carolina (15)
	  * Ohio (18)
	  * Virginia (13)
	  * Wisconsin (10)

By “adopting,” here's what I mean:

	  * Choose only ONE state to adopt so you can focus your energy
	  * Lobby friends and relatives who live in the state
	  * Donate to state candidates in your adopted states hoping they have coattails
	  * Comment on newspapers and blogs that focus on your adopted state, even if not directly political
	  * Call radio talk shows in your adopted state, using their internet broadcast to listen in
	  * Pray

Quite honestly, the Electoral College is stacked heavily against Romney. That means it’s stacked against America’s future, as well.  A landslide for Romney in Missouri won’t help Romney in Florida or Virginia.

Yet we still need to elect [Ed Martin](https://edmartinformissouri.com/), [Todd Akin](https://www.akin.org), [Shane Scholler](https://www.shaneschoeller.org/), [Cole McNary](https://colemcnary.com/), [Peter Kinder](https://peterkinder.com/) and the other Missouri candidates.  We need to elect a solid House delegation. And we need to prevail on statewide and regional referenda.

That’s a lot to do.  And only about 90 days to do it.

**TWO IMPORTANT EVENTS THIS WEEK**

You can get involved beginning this **Wednesday, August 4, at 4:00 p.m. in Valley Park at the Victory Bus Tour Rally**.   All statewide and local candidates will be at the Victory Fieldhouse.  They will making a stop on the Victory Bus Tour and with this being the statewide HQ, it needs to be full!  **Please forward this on to everyone you can**.

**Victory Bus Tour Rally – ALL Statewide and Local Candidates**

Wednesday August 15th – 3:45 – 5 pm
Victory Fieldhouse
932A Meramec Station Rd
Fenton, MO 63088

If you’d like to discuss this further, come out to **Sky Music Lounge this Thursday, August 16, at 7:00 pm, for the next St. Louis Tea Party After Party**. The scheduled topic is Voter Fraud, but we’ll be talking a lot of election strategy, too.

Finally, I need say this:  in 2012, yelling at people, telling them they’re wrong, won’t work.  Sitting the election out because your favorite candidate didn’t win would be like surrendering to the Soviets.  Your children and grandchildren deserve to live as free men and women.  If we lose freedom now, it won’t come back in their lifetimes.  Winning this election might not keep you from the chains of slavery to government, but losing will weld the shackles shut.
