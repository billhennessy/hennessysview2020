Do you know the most persecuted religious group on earth?

History speaks of the massive Roman persecution of Christians. The catacombs of Rome, housing the remains of thousands of Christian martyrs, tell us the story and give voice to the dead.

But the Romans had nothing on we moderns when it comes to persecuting Christians. Today, [Christians are the most persecuted religious group on the planet](https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=39851). And the problem grows worse every day.

Only a blind fool would call the United States a Christian nation. We have become a nation of secular humanists,and our official government policy is the gradual elimination of religion. Christianity first. 

Before you give money to save the rain forests or the whales, consider doing something to save the worldâ€™s most endangered species: the Christian human.
