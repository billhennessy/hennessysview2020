When you’re the Republican Establishment’s candidate, you have one simple assignment: don’t screw up.

](https://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/gop-elephant-dead.jpg)Jason Plummer, a 29-year-old lumber heir, is the GOP Establishment’s appointed candidate for US Congress in Illinois’ 12th Congressional District. He’s facing a shockingly tough race from former police detective and former Belleville Mayor, [Rodger Cook](https://cookforcongress.org/). (Never underestimate a detective’s tenacity.)

 

In a debate last week, Plummer failed his one simple assignment. Despite a nearly unlimited war chest from his family’s fortune and the Illinois GOP treasury, Plummer said something stupid.

 

**Jason Plummer accused FamilyPAC of taking bribes. **

 

FamilyPAC is one of the most active conservative political action committees in Illinois. Republicans for every office look to the organization for its pro-life stamp of approval.

 

Plummer failed to impress FamilyPAC’s endorsement when he ran for Lieutenant Governor 2010. According to the stltoday.com, Paul Caprio, head of FamilyPAC, was unimpressed with Plummer: 

 

>   
> 
> “I had the feeling he was green, politically,” Caprio said. “. . . I just came to the conclusion that this young man is not ready to be running for lieutenant governor.”*

When Plummer failed to gain FamilyPAC’s nod, he went berserk according to Caprio:

> “He was very irate. He was threatening, `I’m never going to forget this, I’m going to get back at you,’ ” said Caprio.

[FamilyPAC appears poised to sue Jason Plummer for defamation](https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/charges-fly-in-gop-primary-race-for-illinois-th-congressional/article_6870fa4d-7f48-50c7-8706-84441338266e.html), according to stltoday.com. 

 

[Plummer has also drawn criticism from grassroots groups for refusing to release his tax returns](https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/illinois/candidate-raising-stakes-in-tax-return-duel-for-illinois-th/article_951ee3f8-6a09-11e1-992c-001a4bcf6878.html). He is the only candidate who’s refused to do so. 

 

[Rodger Cook has already earned Adam Andrzejewski’s pr](https://rebootcongress.blogspot.com/2012/02/video-adam-andrzejewski-praises-rodger.html)aise, in part because of Rodger’s transparency. By highlighting the Rodger Cook’s maturity and integrity, Plummer’s latest gaffe may bring on even** more high-profile conservative endorsements for Cook**.

 

[RebootCongress.com has Rodger Cook’s](https://rebootcongress.blogspot.com/2012/03/rodger-cook-on-jason-plummers-alleged.html) reaction to Plummer’s latest gaffe.

 

The Illinois Primary is next Tuesday, March 20. [Rodger Cook](https://www.facebook.com/cookforcongress) and the other GOP candidates hope to replace long-time Democrate, Jerry Costello, who is retiring after this term.
