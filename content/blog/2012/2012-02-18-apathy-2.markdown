It’s easy to blame the subject for our apathy. The candidates are uninspiring; the colors are dull; the task is boring. 

Blaming the subject is easy because it relieves us, the objects, of any responsibility. “I can’t make Romney less WASPy.” “It’s not my fault that the issues don’t interest me.” 

Of course, there’s another way to look at things. We can ask what we can do, what we can make possible. We can stop worrying about the subject and start worrying about the object.

If you’d like to motivate and educate your object, you can start at the [3rd Anniversary Tea Party](https://3rdanniversaryteaparty.eventbrite.com/) next weekend.
