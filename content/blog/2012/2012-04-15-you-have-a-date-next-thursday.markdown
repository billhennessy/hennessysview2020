Of course you do.

 

It’s at 7:00 at the Crowne Plaza in Clayton. The Crowne Plaza Grille, to be precise. April 19.

 

It’s the April After Party, and the topic is the Missouri plan.[![AfterPartyLogo_300](https://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/afterpartylogo_300_thumb.png)

Your mission: bring one friend who’s never been to a Tea Party event. 

 

If you can’t find someone to bring, come anyway. 

 

Thinking about skipping? Don’t. 

 

The most important election since Lincoln’s first is just seven months away. We’re in the home stretch of the After Party. You country—your grandchildren—needs you now. 

 

See you at 7 on the 19th at the Crowne Plaza.
