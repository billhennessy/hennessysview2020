Last night, someone asked me, “who’s the most influential person in your iPhone contacts?”

“I don’t know,” I said. “Breitbart’s dead.”

](https://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/andrew-breitbart.jpg)[David Carr writes in New York Times about the Life and Death of Andrew Breitbart.](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/fashion/the-life-and-death-of-andrew-breitbart.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all)

_Be advised_ that neither Carr nor NYT shares our political beliefs. And the tactics they cheer from the left, they attack when from the right. Funny how when[ Karen Finney lies about Mitt Romney](https://newsbusters.org/blogs/noel-sheppard/2012/04/13/msnbc-political-analyst-romney-wants-go-back-time-when-women-and-blac), it's good journalism. [When Andrew exposes evil at ACORN](https://www.frugal-cafe.com/public_html/frugal-blog/frugal-cafe-blogzone/2009/09/10/acorn-child-prostitution-story-hits-national-fox-news-breitbarts-new-political-site-big-government-creating-big-waves-video/), it's invective.

Still, it’s testimony to Andrew’s short life that NYT would give him many inches of space (where once there was advertising).

Read the story. And say a prayer the rest of us can fill the vacuum, even if no one can replace him.
