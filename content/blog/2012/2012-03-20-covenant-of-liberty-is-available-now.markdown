Covenant of Liberty is the best American history I’ve read in years. 

 

Michael Patrick Leahy, among a very small group of patriots who hatched the first round of Tea Parties in February 2009, documents the US Government’s 230 year history of Constitutional infidelity. 

 

My full review will be finished soon, but don’t wait: buy Covenant of Liberty today.

Mike Leahy was the keynote speaker on day one of the 3rd Anniversary Tea Party in St. Louis and has been a great friend and ally to STLTPC in our continuing fight for liberty.
