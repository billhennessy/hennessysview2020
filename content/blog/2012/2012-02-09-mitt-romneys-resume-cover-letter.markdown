There are some things you just don’t say in a cover letter—or on the campaign trail.

A self-aggrandizing cover letter from an NYU undergrad to some Wall Street banks has the whole financial world laughing. The kid’s naïve hubris and ignorance of what employers look for in a candidate earned him public humiliation on an internet scale.   Here’s just a sample of the kid’s self-promotion:


> That semester I achieved a 3.93, and in the same time I managed to bench double my bodyweight and do 35 pull-ups

Mitt Romney should be even more embarrassed. He’s a lot older and, theoretically, wiser, you know.

**After Rick Santorum destroyed the establishment’s plastic candidate of choice, Romney’s spokesman gave a remarkably idiotic reason to support Romney: **[**Money and infrastructure**](https://campaign2012.washingtonexaminer.com/article/santorum-surged-romney-and-gingrich-fought/364226)**.**

The reason [Romney won’t beat Obama](https://hennessysview.com/2012-election/new-hampshire-exposes-gops-diverse-base/) and shouldn’t win the GOP nomination is his hubris and his inability to think like a human being. Romney is the reason that Republican voter turnout is abysmal and why [Democrats are now more enthusiastic about voting than Republicans are](https://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2012/02/republican-enthusiasm-issue-is-real.html).

The republic’s greatest threat since the British army of 1812 now sits in the White House.  In 2009 and 2010, the Tea Party resuscitated a comatose GOP and won back the House.  Since then, **the inept, elitist, and self-serving Republican establishment has reasserted its thumb-laden hands, chosen an elitist candidate, and killed enthusiasm among those who actually get out the vote and win elections**—the conservative grass roots.

If Romney and his elitist Republican friends manage to give Obama four more years to destroy this country, the GOP, not Obama, will face the angry mobs of [America’s 60% conservative base](https://hennessysview.com/tea-party/unknowing-believers/).
