Ed Martin Jr. of St. Louis has redirected his fire to the Attorney General race, and this is great news for everyone except Chris Koster.

Back when [Ed Martin](https://edmartinforcongress.com/) was talking about running for the Republican nod to take on Claire McCaskill, I had another thought. Well, a bunch of people had another thought: _Ed would make an outstanding Attorney General_.

*********UPDATE*********

HUGE list of endorsements on [Ed’s official press release](https://us1.campaign-archive1.com/?u=3096f9f3497e58f2da967c33d&id=0f71753ec3&e=bbb3498998).

I guess I was right. [![Ed Martin for Congress](https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/ed-martin-kickoff_thumb.jpg)

I wasn’t disappointed that Ed chose to run for Todd Akin’s US House seat. **Ed would make a great conservative legislator. And as I said before, so will **[**Ann Wagner**](https://annwagner.com/)**,** who can now focus on . . . whichever Democrat decides to give a concession speech at 7:01 pm on November 6. 

But, at this pivotal moment in history, **as Attorney General, Ed Martin will be Missouri’s general in the war on Washington abuse**. Here’s why.

First, **Ed has used his law license for the good of society**, to protect life, to defend the wrongly accused, and to advance his—our—conservative principles. He’s not a lawyer who’s in it for the money. I’ve met some of the people he’s helped, and I’ve heard their stories. 

In these battles, including a nationally covered battle against Illinois’s criminal Governor Rod Blagojevich, **Ed Martin was tenacious, principled, and victorious.**

Missouri needs an AG who will fight for the right things.

Second, **Ed understands that the battle for liberty over the next 12 years will be fought between the states and Washington. **The states—and only the states—have the Constitutional power and the economic leverage fight Washington and win.

The Several States vs. US Government will be ugly,long, and painful. [Insert your analogy here.] Most people will lose their stomach before it’s over. People—even good conservatives—will want to throw in the towel and heel to the Washington monster.

Ed won’t. **He understands that Congress, with its entrenched establishment and elitist snobbery, is as close to a lost cause as you’ll find**. He wants to be one of 50 state attorneys general who, with their governors and secretaries of state, beat Congress into submission.(I said “ugly.”)

Ed Martin has a clear path to take on turncoat Democrat Koster in November. That fight begins today. **When Ed prevails in November, Missouri will have an Attorney General who actually has read and understands the 10th Amendment of the United States Constitution—and a man who’s smart to know it matters.**
