What’s the difference between a caucus and a primary?

Who’s allowed to attend a caucus?

How do I find out my caucus location?

When it the caucus?

How long does it take?

How to do I get ready?

**This Is Important Stuff**

These are just some of the questions I have about the Missouri Republican Presidential Caucus scheduled for March 17. And I’m not the only with questions.

That’s why St. Louis Tea Party Coalition has asked caucus expert Ruth Carlson to _begin_ preparing us for this journey.

On Thursday, January 19, Ruth will give us the fundamental, most important, basic information about the caucus process.

**Don’t Skip the Primary**

Plan to vote The Missouri Presidential Primary on February 7, 2012. Plan to vote. Know why?

Because Ruth told me it’s important. Apparently, party insiders sometimes try to challenge caucus-goers they don’t know. Voting in the Republican primary will insulate you from these charges. Even though the law only requires that you be a registered voter in the district, the insiders sometimes try to put up barriers. 

**And that’s just one of the important lessons Ruth will teach.**

So, mark your calendar right now. Plan to be at [The After Party](https://dev.stlouisteaparty.com/category/the-after-party/) on Thursday, January 19 at 7:00 pm. Location is:

Fallon’s Irish Bar and Grill  
9200 Olive Blvd.,   
Olivette, MO 63132
