Ed Martin's opponent doesn't seem to realize that the job of Missouri's Attorney General is to represent our state. The AG isn't just some high-ranking prosecutor. We have many fine prosecutors protecting us in almost every jurisdiction.

Yes, the Attorney General's office gets involved in state prosecutions. ** But the Attorney General also protects Missouri from Washington overreach.**

Well, the AG is supposed to protect Missouri's interest.  We've been without protection against federal meddling for years. **That's the key distinction between our current Attorney General and Ed Martin.** Chris Koster Super Cop has not lifted a finger to protect you, your family, your business, or your future from Washington politicians. Ed Martin will.

Get protection. **Vote for Ed Martin for Attorney General on November 6**.  Your liberty depends on it.
