From the New York Times:

 

>   
> 
> President Obama, who came to office promising transparency and adherence to the rule of law, has become the first president to claim the legal authority to order an American citizen killed without judicial involvement, real oversight or public accountability. 
> 
> 

 

In one sentence, [the newspaper conservatives love to hate condemned Barack Obama to the title “dictator.”](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/11/opinion/sunday/the-power-to-kill.html?_r=1)

 

Those who voted for him—the ones who still want to be thought of as “American”—will rationalize. They’ll tell[![sheep-stool](https://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/sheep-stool_thumb.jpg)

Every time demands drastic action, though. 

 

America has been, for well over 200 years, the nation where leaders navigated between rocks of tyranny and the shoals of anarchy. 

 

**This generation—a generation of pygmies—has steered us into the rocks. **

 

Let’s hope and pray there’s a generation alive today who can steer this ship safely back into port.
