Even though Congress is winding down, there are dangerous bills on the desk.  I used [Heritage Action’s](https://heritageaction.com/) Popvox program to tell Congressman (and future Senator) [Todd Akin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Akin) I oppose the FARM bill that does less for farmers and more for wasteful government statism.

Here’s the whole slate of bills you should write to Congress about:
