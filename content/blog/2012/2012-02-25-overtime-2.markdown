Just because it’s after 10:00 am, doesn’t mean you can’t come to the [3rd Anniversary Tea Party](https://3rdanniversaryteaparty.eventbrite.com/).

No, we didn’t come up with a policy for people who arrive late to the feast. We will find a way to get you involved that’s fair to everyone.

Grab your laptop or your mobile device, if you have one, get in your car, and drive to the Crowne Plaza in Clayton.  Ask for the Tea Party.

Your country needs you.
