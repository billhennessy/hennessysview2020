Looks different, doesn't it?

After hosting my own web sites forever, I'm trying to simplify my server admin life. I'm moving Hennessy's View to another service from my own servers.

The difference you should see is the theme.  (I'm tired of the minimalism.) Also, some archives from before 2010 might be missing for a while. They'll catch up soon enough.

Thanks

**UPDATE** In addition to the changes above, a couple of comments posted during the upgrade have been lost.  I apologize for that.  If your comment is missing, please repeat it.  Otherwise, I'll try to recover them tonight.
