I’m honored to return to **The Kudlow Report tonight (Wednesday, March 14) at 6:00 pm Central** (7 ET) with Larry Kudlow.

I hope to talk about the GOP Presidential primaries, RomneyCare, and the Tea Party movement.

Please watch if you can.  Good ratings for Tea Party guests will only increase the number of Tea Party guests.
