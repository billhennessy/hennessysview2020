Here’s a screen grab from [RealClearPolitics.com’s presidential tracking poll](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/):

RCP aggregates dozens of polls to produce its RCP average. The method has been [remarkably accurate,](https://www.newsmax.com/Politics/realclearpolitics-mcintyre-bevan-presidential/2012/03/25/id/433813) especially at the state level.

**It’s time to focus on **[**preventing the unmitigated disaster of a second Obama term**](https://hennessysview.com/2012/07/16/just-how-bad-would-a-second-obama-term-be)**.**

In 112 days, Americans will vote on whether or not to continue our experiment in self-government.  **If the election were held today, that experiment would be aborted**.

It gets worse, too.  [At this time in 2008, the much weaker John McCain was in a dead heat with Barack Obama](https://hennessysview.com/2008/07/13/rasmussen-poll-shows-dead-head/).

If you’d like to help continue the experiment, come to [Yacovelli’s Restaurant this Thursday at 7:00 pm](https://www.yacovellis.com/).
