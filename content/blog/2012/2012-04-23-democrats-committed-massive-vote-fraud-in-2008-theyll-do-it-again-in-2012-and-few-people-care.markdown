John McCain knew that Obama's minions orchestrated massive voter fraud in Ohio and Pennsylvania. Besides using New Black Panther Party soldiers to repel McCain voters from the polls,** Democrats stuff ballot boxes to give Obama the win in two states with a combined 41 electoral votes**.

Here's how a memo leaked by wikileaks summarized McCain's election night decision:


> After discussions with his inner circle, which explains the delay in his speech, **McCain decided not to pursue the voter fraud in PA and Ohio, despite his staff's desire to make it an issue**. He said no. Staff felt they could get a federal injunction to stop the process. McCain felt the crowds assembled in support of Obama and such would be detrimental to our country and it would do our nation no good for this to drag out like last go around, coupled with the possibility of domestic violence.

John McCain let it go.  While his supporters were ready to fight with him, as he extolled us to do at the climax of his acceptance speech,  he had no fight left.  He let it go.

Eric Holder refused to prosecute the New Black Panther soldiers. Of course, no one has exposed the people who orchestrated the wider fraud in 2008. These and other factors indicate that Obama will lead the largest election fraud campaigns in US history.

Thanks, McCain.
