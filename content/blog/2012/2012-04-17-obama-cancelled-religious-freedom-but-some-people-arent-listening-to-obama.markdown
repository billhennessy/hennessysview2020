When Obama decreed that Catholics shall support and provide chemical abortions,[ he wasn't promoting women. He was shackling religion](https://hennessysview.com/2012-election/how-you-can-save-religious-freedom-in-america/).

**Totalitarian autocrats don't cotton freedom, unless they personally granted it.**  Obama doesn't believe in individual liberty, but that all power and rights emanate from government. [Timothy Cardinal Dolan agrees](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2012/03/cardinal-dolan-blasts-obamas-contraception-plan-as-freedom-of-religion-battle-video/).

So it's exciting to report that some St. Louisans are fighting back.  Here's the details:

**Protest for Religious Freedom**

**Location:**  Old Courthouse [(Directions)](https://www.stl-defenders.com/index.cfm?load=eventlocation&location=12&page=1&category=1)
**Date:**   Saturday, April 28, 2012
**Time:**   11:00 AM - 12:00 PM

Our rally outside a government building will be held on April 28th at 11:00 a.m.-12:00 noon.  We will have an outstanding list of speakers at this event.  **Zip Rzeppa will be our Master of Ceremony.**

Religious and Tea Party Leaders will encourage us to press for religious freedom.

**The event will be held at the Old Courthouse in downtown St. Louis**.  Please plan on arriving early to find parking as the Cardinals play the Milwaukee Brewers at 12:05 that same day.
