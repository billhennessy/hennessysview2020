**Ed Martin’s new TV commercial is excellent** for many fundamental marketing reasons. Ed’s energy, commitment, and love of people shines through.

Still, the commercial is a waste of time and money **unless people see it**.

**Here’s how you can help**:  [buy air time](https://edmartinformissouri.com/wastenot). If you want an Attorney General who will protect Missouri’s sovereignty and treasury, [you can simply buy air time for this ad](https://edmartinformissouri.com/wastenot).

And there’s more you can do. **Get involved in GOTV projects**. Visit the [Victory Fieldhouse in Valley Park](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Victory-Fieldhouse/356762387723824) (141 at I-44), the [AFP Field office in St. Peters, MO](https://americansforprosperity.org/failingagenda/event/st-peters-missouri), or the [St. Louis Tea Party-Madison Project Liberty HQ in South County](https://stlouisteaparty.com/).



	  * Put **bumper stickers** on all your cars, front and back
	  * Put up **yard signs** for Ed Martin, Todd Akin, and other great candidates
	  * **Call **some of the 1.2 million Missouri conservatives who don’t vote consistently
	  * Go **door-to-door** to get out the vote of people who believe what you believe but don’t always vote
	  * **Donate to conservative candidates who don’t get [big checks from billionaires](https://hennessysview.com/2012/09/30/ignoramus-rex/)**

If you weren’t the kind of people who work hard to keep America strong, I wouldn’t bother asking.

**St. Louis Tea Party’s HQ is open Noon to 8 pm Monday-Friday and Noon to 3 Saturday**.

See you there!
