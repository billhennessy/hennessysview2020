The liberal press cannot issue a story about the Republican presidential race that does not refer to Mitt Romney’s need (and inability) to “relate to” conservatives. Puke.

Relate to this: **if Mitt Romney’s a conservative, I’m a Hottentot**.

By “relate to,” the media and Romney’s handlers actually mean “hoodwink.” While Romney might secure the GOP nomination without conservative support, his campaign will go down in flames without [conservative grassroots boots on the ground from Labor](https://3rdanniversaryteaparty.eventbrite.com) Day to Election Day.

**The only way Romney can win the hearts and minds of conservatives is to relive the past 20 years of his life. This time as a conservative.**

Romney might [win more favor among conservatives](https://swampland.time.com/2012/02/10/at-cpac-romney-stresses-conservative-credentials/) by simply acknowledging who and what he is: an East Coast, Blue Blood, Rockefeller Republican with severely elitist views of government’s role in people’s lives. ([And by “people” I include corporations](https://reason.com/blog/2011/08/11/romney-corporations-are-people).)
