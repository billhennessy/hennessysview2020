Conservatives love cracking on government and its unintended consequences. How often does a government initiative give us backassward results?

Exhibit A: Obama hands Solyndra millions in tax dollars to promote green energy. Solyndra (and numerous other green energy grant recipients) goes bankrupt.

Another example is the St. Louis Board of Police Commissioners.

In 1861, [Missouri’s legislature created a board of commissioners to oversee the St. Louis Police Department](https://www.stlmag.com/St-Louis-Magazine/April-2010/Think-Again-Don-039t-Know-Much-About-History/). Why? Because Missouri was a slave state, but St. Louis was full of Unionists who might use the police to advance the cause of abolition. Missouri’s rural politicians created the board to better control that police force.

Over time, of course, that governor-appointed board has given St. Louis and Missouri a great police department. The oversight from Jefferson City limits the amount of corruption on the city’s police department.

It’s an irony only government could create. **A board intended to deny basic God-given liberties and rights to slaves became a crucial tool in protecting liberty and rights and fairness and justice in the city of St. Louis for a century and a half. **

That’s why [both the NAACP and the ACLU oppose Proposition A](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CCIQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fstlouis.cbslocal.com%2F2012%2F09%2F28%2Fnaacp-and-aclu-warn-of-local-control-problems%2F&ei=MFpqUPKaAaTnyAHJroBw&usg=AFQjCNEOMrNEBUQnTl1G9v2SoWTyH8sAQA&sig2=aSl2vouKRwHw-HQgksiKSA). And, for once in my life,** I agree with the NAACP and the ACLU.  Vote No on Proposition A November 6. **
