The new fad among Democrats is to see **how many illegal aliens they can pack into a voting booth**.  While we conservatives decry this illegal and anti-American grab at tyrannical power, we should take some solace in this sobering fact: those illegal aliens probably know as much about the American political system as most 13th generation Americans.

The fact is, **most Americans are too stupid about politics to vote**, which explains the 2008 election.

Just look at these [horrendous numbers from Xavier University](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/one-in-three-americans-fail-immigrant-naturalization-civics-test-149209975.html):

For example, when asked questions about our government and political leaders, the survey results found:



	  * 85% did not know the meaning of the "the rule of law."
	  * **82% could not name "two rights stated in the Declaration of Independence."**
	  * 75% were not able to correctly answer "What does the judiciary branch do?"
	  * **71% were unable to identify the Constitution as the "supreme law of the land."**
	  * 68% did not know how many justices are on the Supreme Court.
	  * 63% could not name one of their two US Senators.
	  * **62% could not identify "What happened at the Constitutional Convention?"**
	  * 62% could not answer "the name of the Speaker of the US House."

Who doesn't want the highest possible number of people to vote?  I don't.

My vote should not have to compete with that of a moron who can't blurt out "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" when asked to name the rights mentioned in the Declaration of Independence. (A "moron" is someone with a mental age between 8 and 12, for those of you who vote Democrat.)

**If you don't know that the Constitution is the supreme law of the land, you should not be allowed to vote--photo ID or not**.  Nor should your political opinions carry weight among the 15 percent in this country who actually know something.

Combined with another survey released last week showing that[ liberals are politically ignorant, closed-minded, judgmental, hate-mongers](https://dailycaller.com/2012/04/22/science-say-gop-voters-better-informed-open-minded/), you realize that the voting franchise has been diluted too far.
