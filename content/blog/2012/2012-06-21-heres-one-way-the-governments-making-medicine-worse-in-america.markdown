I had to go to the doctor today. The reason's not important.  Here's what is:

**It took my doctor 10 minutes to describe my symptoms into a government-mandated voice recognition system.  [![](https://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/04_dictaphone.jpg)
](https://ludicrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/04_dictaphone.jpg)**

In the old days, the doctor took notes.  Now, he has to recite his observations into a Mad Men-era dictaphone. "Male, age 48, blood pressure one-twenty-one over seventy-three . . . "

**The damn machine (government medical technology) couldn't understand half the doctor's words.**  And they were household words, like "absent," "weight-lifter," and "bleeding."

This is the DMV in your doctor's office.  This is bureau-care.  This is Obamacare--a ten minute exam stretched to twenty with aggravation driven through the roof.

Let's pray like mad the Supreme Court's ruling will rule Obamacare unconstitutional.  And I wouldn't mind it if the majority opinion included a second opinion: "And it's stupid."

BTW, The After Party is at** Helen Fitzgerald's at 7 tonight** (Thursday, June 21). And the LATimes believes the** Supreme Court could hand down its Obamacare ruling** today (Thursday).  That makes The After Party your chance to **celebrate victory** or plot our next move.

See you Helen's at 7.
