When the Supreme Court rules on ObamaCare, it will define Barack Obama as either a winner or loser.

James Carville says overturning ObamaCare would be the best thing that could happen to Democrats. I think he’s wrong. 

 

ObamaCare is the centerpiece of Obama’s term in office. He put all of America’s business on hold for a year to pass it. He coerced, lied, intimidated, and threatened to get the law passed. It consumed him.

 

**If Barack Obama’s only major accomplishment turns out to be a very divisive, very expensive, very distracting assault on the Constitution, the only word that will fit him is “loser.” **

 

But if Anthony Kennedy can be persuaded to break the Constitution, Obama will be, more or less, our dictator. If the law is upheld, people will see him as a winner because people flock to power. 

 

**The republic hangs in the balance.**
