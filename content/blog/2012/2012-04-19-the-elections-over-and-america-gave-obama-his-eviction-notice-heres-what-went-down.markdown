The look on George “Stephie” Stephanopoulos’s face was priceless. He had to say it.

“**ABC News now projects that President Obama will go down to defeat**.”

He couldn’t bring himself to say, “Romney won” or “Republicans won.”  He just couldn’t.

The network analysis was a political cliché run amok. My favorite came from James Carville who told CNN viewers that the election result “proves that crackers and racists vote.”

Andrea Mitchell: “Usually in a democracy, you get the government you deserve. In this case, America reject the government so desperately needs.”

Wolff Blitzer: “**The Obama era’s days are numbered, and America’s might be, too**.”

As map turned red in key states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina, and Florida, the anchors turned a sickly shade of white on NBC, MSNBC, CNN, ABC, and CBS.  Jesse Jackson announced on CNN that “I am too distraught to rhyme because this election was a wrongdoing.”

Here’s how it came about.



	  * [Obama ate dog](https://www.businessinsider.com/barack-obama-ate-a-dog-conservatives-response-to-mitt-romney-seamus-2012-4). Sure, Romney gave into his dog’s desire to ride on the roof of the car, but Obama ATE dog. Dog meat turns off voters.
	  * Romney Ran Right. Independents want a president with commitment and competence.  They are right of center, but they’ll vote left if the right disappoints. Candy-ass centrist Republicans disappointment, so they vote for the Dem.  But Romney ran toward the right, locking in the Reagan Democrats and independents.
	  * Obama’s presidency was incompetent, narcissistic, arrogant, and anti-American.  That’s not a good combination.
	  * Popular and effective conservative governors, Senators, and representatives did a fabulous job promoting other conservatives instead of running up their own scores or buying favors from moderates.
	  * Ron Paul visibly worked for Romney and Republicans on the under card.
	  * **The Supreme Court rules Obama attempted, and failed, to corrupt the Constitution through Obamacare**, uncovering for many Obama’s authoritarian aims.
	  * The economy sputtered.
	  * Some Democrats, fearing the gallows of history, refused to endorse or openly abandoned Obama.
	  * **Tea Partiers realized that four more year of Obama would leave their children and grandchildren living like the Soviets** . . . and supported the Republicans big time.

Less than six months’ time separates us from November.  This scenario, frankly, is far less probable than [my previous scenario in which the GOP gets slaughtered.](https://hennessysview.com/2012/04/15/the-elections-over-and-the-republicans-got-creamed-heres-what-went-wrong/)  But this one is plausible.

**What is one thing you can do to produce this outcome instead of the other? **
