[Rodger Cook](https://cookforcongress.org/) fools no one into thinking he’s a member of the political class. He’s not. Rodger’s a human being, like the rest of us. That’s just one of the reasons that **Rodger Cook has earned my personal endorsement in next Tuesday’s (March 20) Illinois primary.***

Actually, Rodger’s not so much like the rest of us. Rodger has served the people of Illinois all of his adult life. Rodger has been a police officer, a detective, a mayor, and private businessman. He’s an inventor—creating the world’s first one-page softball score book for keeping score easier. (I love this idea—you never have to put your beer down!)

 

As mayor of Belleville, the largest city in Illinois’ 12th district, Cook ran up an amazing string of promises kept, including improving relations with city workers, expanding the city, and fixing Belleville’s fiscal mess. That last skill will be vital in Washington, DC, for the next two years.

 

Rodger is founder of Metro East Fellowship of Christian Athletes and long-time member of the St. Louis area chapter. He has _earned_ the trust and endorsement of numerous conservative, pro-life, and family organizations, including FamilyPAC. He has been endorsed by the Fraternal Order of Police.

 

Everyone in America will thank the people of southern Illinois when they send Rodger Cook to Congress in 2012.
