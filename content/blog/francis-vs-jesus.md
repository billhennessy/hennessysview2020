Pope Francis is trying to erase the Bible. 

Specifically, Francis wants to deny Matthew 28:18-20, better known as The Great Commission:

> And Jesus coming, spoke to them, saying: All power is given to me in heaven and in earth. Going therefore, teach ye all nations; baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and behold I am with you all days, even to the consummation of the world.

In Francis's view, baptism is a sin. A sin against the brotherhood of man.
