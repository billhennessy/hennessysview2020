> Estimates of the number of Vietnamese boat people who died at sea can only be guessed. According to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, between 200,000 and 400,000 boat people died at sea. Other wide-ranging estimates are that 10 to 70 percent of Vietnamese boat people died at sea.[^1]

In the aftermath of the US withdrawal from Vietnam in 1975, over one million refugees attempted to flee the war-torn country by sea. The exodus create an international humanitarian crisis that helped bring down the presidency of Jimmy Carter and pave the way for Ronald Reagan. 

In addition to the 200,000 to 400,000 lives lost at sea, countless women and girls were abducted by pirates. We can only imagine why. 

As voices on the left and right call for an immediate US withdrawal from the Middle East, it's wise to consider the effects similar sudden withdrawals of force have created in the past. 

We should also, however, accept that the open-ended presence of US forces in the Middle East bring dangers. As the father of two US service members on active duty and frequently deployed to the region, I know well the dangers. I spend hours on my knees praying for their safe return. I panic every time there's unexpected knock on our front door. As I'm sure my parents did when I was deployed on submarines during the Cold War. As their parents did when my dad and my mom's brothers served in World War II and Korea. 

Further, I still believe what I wrote in _The Conservative Manifesto_ in 1993:

> Remaining free from involvement in disputes that do not directly affect ourselves, our allies, or our national interests means just that: a free nation cannot morally send its volunteer soldiers and sailors to their deaths if not sending them would not affect the lives of most Americans.[^2]

I mention my sons and my positions only to point out that I am not a Neo-con interventionist. I will admit, however, having grown up a fervent anti-Communist and Cold Warrior, I have little patience for knee-jerk responses to danger that involve ignoring geopolitical problems until the enemy strikes the homeland. 

And a lot of knees are twitching this weekend. The twitchiness is a response to the news that the US killed Iranian terrorist Major General Qassem Soleimani with a drone strike on January 2. The attack was a response to Soleimani's planning and execution of an armed attack on the US embassy in Baghdad, Iraq, reminiscent of the November 4, 1979 Iranian "student" takeover of the US embassy in Tehran, Iran, in which Soleimani participated. 

The US response to the attempted embassy takeover was swift and deadly. Soleimani, who had been on American anti-terrorism radar since at least 2000, was responsible for over 600 confirmed US deaths and thousands of US casualties over 20 years as leader of the al Qud force of the Iranian Republican Guard. 

While most on the right support the US attack on al Qud leadership, many opposed it. Those opposed seem to believe that Neo-conservative warhawks pressured President Trump in order to trigger a larger regional war with Iran. This faction favors rapid abandonment of the Middle East in order spare American lives. In essence, they are looking out for my boys, and they have no patience for a gradual withdrawal. 

For example, look at a portion of my exchange last night with Eric Sammons, on of my favorite Catholic writers:

Eric's response disappointment me, but it's consistent with those of people who want the US to abandon the Middle East:

{{< twitter 1213670638591893504 >}}

Maybe you didn't catch it, but Mr. Sammons changed the subject rather abruptly. My response was about an honorable withdrawal from the Middle East. His objection was to our incursion into Afghanistan in 2001. 

Mr. Sammons is very smart guy. Moreover, he's a very thoughtful guy. I've seen him on live YouTube interviews discussing very complex theological topics. He follows the host's points and stays on point. 

So why could he not stay on point regarding the US presence in the Middle East? 

There's an old saying that you can't reason a person out of a position they didn't reason themselves into. It means that emotions trump reason, 100% of the time. Mr. Sammons has spent years studying theology. He has _reasoned_ himself into his theological positions, so he's well equipped to provide reasoned responses to challenges to those positions. 

I assume that Mr. Sammons has spent far less time studying and contemplating geopolitics. Lacking the informed reason about the effects of US presence in a region, his emotions take over. His emotions reacted to my mild challenge by dredging a different subject. I was talking about withdrawal; his emotions were talking about incursion. 

I don't mean to attack or belittle Eric. I do the exact same thing all the time. I think I'm responding with reason, but I'm actually reacting emotionally. You do it, too. It's how the human brain operates. 

But arm-chair diagnoses of my exchange with Eric Sammons doesn't answer the question "should the US abandon the Middle East?" 

My answer is "no," and here's why. As we saw at the open, when a super power abandons an unstable region it creates a vacuum. Something fills that vacuum. 

In Vietnam, it was a particularly brutal form of Communism. In the Middle East, it will be something with means and motive to establish hegemony in the region. 

Both Russia and Iran have some means and some motivation to fill a void left by the United States. Russia has superior means, but Iran has far more compelling motivation. 

The Mullahs of Iran have tried to dominate the Middle East since the 1980s. Under almost constant economic and political sanctions, Iran would benefit greatly from access to oil reserves in Iraq and Syria. The same could be said for Russia.

But Iran has an ideological-religious motive that Russia lacks. Iran's Shia theocrats believe that by establishing a sufficient caliphate, the 12th Imam will emerge from hiding. 

> Mahdi is a title meaning “guided one.” He is anticipated as the perfect Muslim who will reappear and unite the world under Islam. According to Shia beliefs, Muhammad bin al-Hasan was born near the end of the ninth century and was no longer seen after the middle of the tenth century. This disappearance was supposedly not the result of death but of a divine cloaking, known as occultation.[^3]
