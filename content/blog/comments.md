I changed the commenting system to Commento from Disqus. For my frequenty commenters, this may require you to re-authenticate. (Sorry, but security, ya know.)

I did this for two reasons:

1. Disqus sells user information, and Commento does not. Commento, therefore, respects your privacy more.
2. Disqus slows down my pageload time, and Commento does not. Commento, therefore, respects your time.

I have migrated all the old comments to the new platform, so anything you posted previously should appear. Thank you for your comments. 

Happy New Year!

Go Blues!
