In the past 15 years, Kirkwood School Districts operation costs have skyrocketed almost 100 percent. But the people paying the taxes for that district have seen a cost of living increase of only 44 percent.

Obviously, at some point, the system will crash. Unless you do something now.

**On April 2, you can elect two fiscally responsible members to the board of education**.




[Eric Peterson](https://peterson4kirkwoodschools.com/) and [Amy Russell](https://www.educatekirkwood.org/)




Here’s what you should do:

1.  [Visit Kirkwood Pioneers for Educational Progress](https://www.k-pep.org/) to learn all about the issues that threaten your district’s financial future and the opportunities to make the district even stronger.

2.  Get to know [Eric Peterson](https://peterson4kirkwoodschools.com/) and [Amy Russell](https://www.educatekirkwood.org/).

3.  Tell your friends you’re voting on April 2 for fiscal responsibility and better schools.

That’s it.

**Unless you want to be a real High Information Voter**. Then [you will want to read K-PEP’s Executive Summary](https://www.k-pep.org/index.cfm?load=page&page=43). You’ll be the real education expert in your conversation groups, and your opinion will carry a lot of weight with other voters.

Just because you don’t have children in school right now doesn’t mean you’re free of the duty to be informed and to vote.

Good school districts raise property values and improves lives. Fiscally irresponsible districts threaten the whole community.

Don’t leave this duty up to anyone else. Take responsibility for your community by getting informed and voting.
