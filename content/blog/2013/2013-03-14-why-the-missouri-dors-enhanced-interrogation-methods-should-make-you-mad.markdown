_[Pulled from comments, in response to TJ, you asked](https://hennessysview.com/2013/03/13/breaking-dem-appointed-director-of-missouri-revenue-caught-lying-to-senate/): "I am somewhat confused about the current outrage. Shouldn’t the DOR verify, to the greatest extent possible, that an applicant for renewal of any state issued ID be who they maintain to be, live where they claim to live and so on."_

If you’re buying beer at Schnuck’s, you expect the cashier to card you, right? That’s because the cashier is required to verify your are 21 or older.

**Wouldn’t you think it creepy if the cashier took your picture and photocopied your driver’s license?**

](https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Missouri-Department-of-Revenue-Prying-Eyes1.png) Missouri DOR (Department of Revenue) records your personal identifiable information in violation of Missouri law. Lawmakers in Jefferson City are working on legislation to force DOR to comply with existing laws.[/caption]

When you ask him why he took your picture and copied your DL, what if he told you, “I’m going to forward this information to the federal government. I don’t know why they want to know that you bought beer today, but they do.”

There’s no difference here. A fee collection office is just a supermarket for licenses and permits. The DOR’s verification duties are set by Missouri law. So are its limits.

**Missouri law prohibits DOR from recording, by any means, personal identifying information.** Missouri law also prohibits Missouri DOR from sharing that information.

The DOR fee office employees are under orders from the state to violate the law.**Fee office workers were the first contact Missouri Family Network because they knew that they were breaking the law by using the new equipment and process.**

I’m posting my reply to a comment on [my first story about the Missouri DOR’s use of enhanced interrogation techniques](https://hennessysview.com/2013/03/13/breaking-dem-appointed-director-of-missouri-revenue-caught-lying-to-senate/) on people trying to renew driver’s licenses and concealed carry permits. Thanks to commenter, TJ, for challenging me.
