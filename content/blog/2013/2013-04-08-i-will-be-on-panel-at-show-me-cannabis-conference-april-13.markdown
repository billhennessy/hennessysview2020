Gary Weigert, State Rep. Paul Curtman, and I will share a panel at [Show-Me Cannabis Reform Spring Conference Saturday, April 13](https://secure.nationalcannabiscoalition.com/page/contribute/spring-cannabis-law-reform-conference) from 1:45 to 2:30 pm at the Crowne Plaza Downtown, 200 N. Fourth St.

Our panel discusses the conservative case for marijuana law reform. 

I am honored by the invitation, and I’d love to see a big turnout of tea partiers for the event.
