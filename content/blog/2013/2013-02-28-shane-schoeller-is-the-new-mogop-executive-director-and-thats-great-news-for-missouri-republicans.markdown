Shane Schoeller narrowly missed winning the job he and I wish he had: Missouri Secretary of State. Shane lost—along with every other non-incumbent Republican for a statewide office.

](https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Schoeller.jpg) Shane Schoeller becomes the new Missouri Republican Party Executive Director. Party Chairman Ed Martin made the announcement on February 28, 2013[/caption]

The good news is that Missouri Republican Chairman, **[Ed Martin, has tapped Shane Schoeller as the party’s Executive Director](https://www.mogop.org/2013/02/6797/).**

There were some fabulous candidates under consideration, which made the selection process difficult.

“Shane’s a good solid conservative and he has connections across the state,” Ed Martin told me by phone this morning. I agree.

Those connection will be important after the disastrous 2012 election. Despite success in growing their numbers in the Missouri legislature, Republicans lost every statewide race except Lieutenant Governor.

Ed Martin and Shane have a huge job in front of them, and it won’t be easy. The GOP Establishment has shown little interest in seeing them succeed. Meanwhile, the grassroots movement of 2009 and 2010 feels exhausted after keeping an unappreciative GOP alive for four years—with little help from the party itself.

I wish Shane all the best. It won’t be easy, but I’m ready to help him succeed.
