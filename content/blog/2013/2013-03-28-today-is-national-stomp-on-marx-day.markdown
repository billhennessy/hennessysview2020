[Stomping on things is all the rage on some college campuses](https://godfatherpolitics.com/10084/university-apologizes-to-student-who-wouldnt-stomp-on-jesus/). But the kids are missing out on the real fun.

Here’s an exercise I highly recommend for teachers of kids age 14 and up.

Stomp On Marx!

**Here’s how you do it**.

1. Download and print this picture of the father of communism, Karl Marx. (click for larger image)

2. Ask each student to stand and stare at the image for 30 seconds.

3. Ask the student to place the image on the floor in front of him or her, face up.

4. Ask the student to Stomp On Marx—right in the middle of his face.

Remember, print only ONE copy of the picture and make all the kids share it . . . because Marx would have wanted it that way.

After the last student is done, ask the class to write a short paragraph describing the experience. Then give everybody an A no matter how half-assed or idiotic the paragraphs were.

Better yet, assign legitimate grades for the writing quality, the honesty, and the thoughtfulness of each paragraph. Write the letter grade on a Post-It Note for each paragraph and stick it to the paper. Then instruct all the students who received an A to trade their grade with a student who got an F. Bs switch with Ds.  Cs get to keep their mediocre, “showed no effort” grades.

Hang the short essays on the wall outside the class. Hang the mutilated image of Karl Marx above the essays.

Finally, **update your resume**, because you’re about to embark on a new career.
