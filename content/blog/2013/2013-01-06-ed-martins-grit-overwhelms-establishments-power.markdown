In a blow to the old guard establishment,** the Missouri Republican State Committee elected Ed Martin Jr. as its new party chairman**.

Roy Blunt and all six Republican members of Congress from Missouri lobbied the new state committee over the past few weeks to block Ed and retain the establishment’s choice, David Cole. [Jo Mannies of the St. Louis Beacon wrote](https://www.stlbeacon.org/#!/content/28741/martin_mogop_chairman_010513?coverpage=2479):

> Cole’s loss appears to be a setback for Missouri’s GOP establishment. U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt and all six Missouri Republicans in the U.S. House had signed a letter backing Cole’s re-election.

> Martin’s win was seen as a victory for the Missouri GOP’s more conservative factions, including some tea party groups – notably the St. Louis Tea Party, whose founder Bill Hennessy had endorsed Martin.

**The victory demonstrates the power of grit—one of Ed Martin’s most valuable qualities**. Ed narrowly lost his bid to unseat former Congressman Russ Carnahan in 2010. In that race, Ed came closer than any Republican in recent memory to taking Missouri’s old 3rd District away from Democrats. Ed’s gritty campaign solidified his standing with grassroots tea partiers. 

[Grit is the most important factor in success](https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/03/what-is-success-true-grit/) according to human behavioral scientists. As Jonah Lehrer explains:

> After analyzing the data, Duckworth discovered the importance of a psychological trait known as grit. In previous papers, Duckworth has demonstrated that grit can be reliably measured with a short survey that measures consistency of passions (e.g., ‘‘I have been obsessed with a certain idea or project for a short time but later lost interest’’) and consistency of effort (e.g., ‘‘Setbacks don’t discourage me’’) over time using a 5-point scale. Not surprisingly, those with grit are more single-minded about their goals – they tend to get obsessed with certain activities – and also more likely to persist in the face of struggle and failure. Woody Allen famously declared that “Eighty percent of success is showing up”. Grit is what allows you show up again and again.

**Ed put in the 10,000 hours of practice.** His dogged campaigns in 2010 and 2012 gave him the courage and earned him the privilege to show up. 

After losing his bid to unseat Attorney General Chris Koster last November, a lot people wanted Ed to give up politics. But Ed’s no quitter. Instead,** he rallied his considerable charm and tenacity** to take on a role that is well suited to Ed Martin’s skill and experience. 

Missouri’s Democrats and even some conservatives mockingly said “Ed finally won an election.” The Democrats should be very worried that a talent as gritty and popular as Ed Martin now chairs the Missouri GOP. Conservative might want to review [Abraham Lincoln’s electoral history](https://www.wealthforteens.com/teen-personal-growth/abraham-lincoln-didnt-quit/) before mocking the resilience of a man who never gives up. 

Congratulations, also, to Trish Vincent, Auditor Tom Schweich’s chief of staff, elected Chairwoman, or co-chair in today’s PC-speak. And a special congratulations and thanks to Frieda Keogh of Missouri Precinct Project and a new member of the Republican State Committee. Frieda’s efforts to advance grassroots causes and candidates is a gift to Missouri and America.
