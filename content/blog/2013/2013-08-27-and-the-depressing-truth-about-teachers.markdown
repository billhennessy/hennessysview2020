Samantha. 

She's the daughter every parent hopes for. Diligent. Dedicated. Kind to a fault. Smart. Hard working. Loyal. Prettier than she knows. 

She gets it from her mother.

She's about to graduate from college and become a teacher. 

Like her mom.

She doesn't need a union. 

She is a union. 

With her mom.

And a million others.

They care. And try. And teach. Or try. 

Your kid would be blessed to walk into Sam's classroom one day.

Or her mom's. 

But strong unions won't let her teach and care the way God and her mom prepared her to teach and care. The union doesn't care. Except for itself.

Samantha is a listener.
