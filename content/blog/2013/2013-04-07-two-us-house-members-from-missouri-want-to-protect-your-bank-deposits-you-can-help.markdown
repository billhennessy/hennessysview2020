“Over my dead body.”[![Ann_Wagner_t670](https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Ann_Wagner_t670_thumb.jpg)
](https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Ann_Wagner_t670.jpg)

That’s how Rep. Ann Wagner’s (R-MO) described her opposition to any attempts by the US government to seize retirement accounts or bank deposits.

Here’s the full quote: “I am solidly behind this resolution and over my dead body will the USG ever raid our personal savings or retirement accts!!”

**Thank you, Ann, for that unequivocal statement on the matter. **


#### Billy Long’s HR 129 To Protect Retirement Income and Bank Deposits


And thanks to [Rep. Billy Long (R-MO) for introducing House Resolution 129](https://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/289213-cyprus-banking-crisis-inspires-house-resolution-against-raiding-savings-accounts) (HR-129). Here’s what Long said of the bill, via The Hill:


> The government should not tax people's private savings accounts, which they have already paid taxes on, especially for the purpose of funding more bailouts. I was shocked by the news that some countries might be considering these kinds of taxes, and I think Congress should say that this kind of tax won't happen in America.


It’s a shame that a member of Congress would even have to say that, isn’t it?


#### Obama’s Budget Calls for Caps on Retirement Income


The [Obama Administration wants to cap retirement savings at $205,000 a year](https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-04-06/obama-proposes-retirement-account-limit-first-wealth-tax-salvo). In other words, Obama believes no one should make more than $205,000 a year in retirement. [No one, no matter how hard they worked](https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/business/general_business/april_2013/55_think_most_rich_people_earned_their_money_through_hard_work), whether they invented the personal computer or the world’s largest social network, should enjoy the fruits of their retirement. From ZeroHedge.com:


> Obama plans to set a limit of how much one can spend per year on retirement through tax-preferred retirement plans. As it turns out, **according to the Obama administration it is only fair to spend a total of $205,000 in nominal dollars per year on retirement, but not more**.




#### Tax-Consuming Federal Retirees Exempt


Except maybe retired federal workers.

According to USAToday, [at least six retired federal workers make over $200,000 a year](https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/perfi/retirement/story/2012-07-19/federal-pensions-in-excess-of-100-thousand/57059716/1), siphoned from taxpayers. Another 2,100 make more than $100,000 in retirement.


> Some 1.2% of federal retirees collect six-figure pensions. By comparison, 0.1% of military retirees collect as much. The [New York State](https://content.usatoday.com/topics/topic/New+York+State) and Local Retirement System pays 0.2% of its retirees pensions of $100,000 or more. The[New Jersey](https://content.usatoday.com/topics/topic/Places,+Geography/States,+Territories,+Provinces,+Islands/U.S.+States/New+Jersey) retirement system pays 0.4% of retirees that much. Comparable private figures aren't available.


Anyone who said of Cyprus, “this couldn’t happen in America,” was wrong. Obama’s already planning it.


#### Here’s What You Can Do


First, please contact Billy Long and Ann Wagner and thank them for defending your retirement and bank savings. Politicians rarely hear “thank you” from constituents when they do the right thing. They are people, after all. [Positive feedback works](https://www.safeandcivilschools.com/research/references/positive-feedback-ratio-of-interactions.php), and [expressing gratitude will make your life better](https://www.bakadesuyo.com/2012/08/here-are-the-things-that-are-proven-to-make-y/).

Next, encourage your members of Congress to fight Obama’s money grab. His entire budget is study in media-manipulation and wealth destruction.

Finally, forward this post 3 friends who live in Missouri and ask them to thank Billy and Ann, too. Try a snail-mail letter or phone call instead of an email if you really want to stand out.
