David Hanneberry lost the love of his life in the capture of Suspect Two—his boat.

@ColorMeRed inspired the idea of [buying him a new one](https://www.gofundme.com/buy-hanneberry-a-boat). 

I’ve started a [GoFundMe account to raise $30,000 in 30 days to fund a new boat for Mr. Hanneberry](https://www.gofundme.com/buy-hanneberry-a-boat). C’mon, folks, this guy’s a hero. He discovered Tsarnaev in his boat and called the cops. He had the courage to lift the canvas and verify that the bastard was in in there. 

And I know the boat meant a lot to him. His stepson told Greta Van Susteren that, next to his wife, that boat was David’s greatest love. The stepson also praised Mr. Hanneberry, telling me he’s a really good guy.

You can pledge whatever you can afford, and every dollar helps. If we don’t meet our goal of 30K in 30 Days, you won’t owe a penny.

Don’t wait. Let’s get the momentum going. Donate today and tell 3 friends to donate, too.
