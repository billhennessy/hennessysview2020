"I shouldn't have to offer _anything_."  Barack Obama on why he's shutting down the government.

Obama keeps forgetting he's not a dictator. Or maybe _I_ keep forgetting he is.

Did you see that list of government shutdowns?

1976, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1986, 1987, 1990, 1995.

Those first four shutdowns came with Democrat majorities in both houses of Congress.

And none of them affected the next election. None.

[John Boehner ](https://hennessysview.com/2013/09/28/ive-learned-house-gop-lot-tougher-senate/)just gave the speech of his life on the floor of the House. He demonstrated what a belligerent, spoiled child Obama is. He explained what fair means. He described the numerous concessions and attempts to negotiate initiated by the Republicans.

And every single outreached Republican hand came back slapped by Obama and Harry Reid.

Why?

Because Obama and Reid want a shutdown.

Let them have it.

Just don't stop reminding people that the House has passed three bills to fund the government. All three bills reflected the will of the people. All three bills were less than conservatives wanted.

And all three bills were rejected by Harry Reid and Barack Obama.

Tell @BarackObama to stop acting like a tin-horn dictator and start acting like a man.

BUT . . .

If the House caves and passes a "clean" CR, 2014 could look like 1974.
