I can be pretty hard on Republicans. [Not hard enough for some](https://hennessysview.com/2013/10/06/responsible-rino-hunter). Too hard for others.

**But I, at least, try to time my battles for ideological consistency**. As a general rule, odd-numbered years are for cleaning up the GOP. Even-numbered years are for cleaning out Democrats.

This is an odd-numbered year. Right up to the votes on the continuing resolution,[ my primary targets were Republicans](https://hennessysview.com/2013/09/25/expect-much-republicans-obamacare/), especially [Roy Blunt](https://hennessysview.com/2013/09/24/roy-blunt-failed-missouri-today/).

Once the House exercised its Constitutional power of the purse strings, sending a popular continuing resolution to the Senate, the battle lines shifted. Obama declared war on reason and Republicans.

Once that happened, we had a choice. We could help Obama by attacking the House Republicans' right flank.

Or we can fight Obama by riding to the aid of our closest ideological allies in Congress.

Maybe I'm wrong, but I'm riding with the Boehner, Ann Wagner, Jason Smith, Billy Long, and the other resilient House Republicans. After we put down the tyrannical King Barack, there'll be plenty of time to squabble with Boehner.
