Submitted by Bob, the retiree:

To the Millennials of America,

All you sniveling, whining, crybaby Millennials need to quit your complaining and get signed up with Obamacare as soon as possible.

We really don’t care what it costs you. I am retired now and drawing my Social Security and will sign up for Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps and any other Social program available, as soon as I can qualify. I'm entitled, you know!

We need you bunch of sniveling crybabies to get on board so you can pay for these programs. How else am I going to be able to siphon off your wealth? You do believe in wealth redistribution don’t you? You don’t deserve all that wealth you have now or will earn in the future. It’s your obligation to share it with us. We're entitled to some of it.

Quit griping, quit sniveling, quit complaining and get signed up now, you hear! That’s an order.

Bob, The Retiree
