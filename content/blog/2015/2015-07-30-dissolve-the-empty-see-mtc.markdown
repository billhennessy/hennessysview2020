The Holy See is in Rome.  
The Empty See is in St. Louis.

The Metropolitan Taxicab Commission (MTC) is a racket to protect incumbent taxicab companies. They use their power to keep St. Louis in the stone age of transportation.

[It’s time to dissolve the MTC](https://duanelester.com/2015/07/29/coward-st-louis-metropolitan-taxicab-commission-delays-vote-on-uber/). It has served its purpose and outlived its usefulness. [Like the riverboat commission of the 1850s](https://hennessysview.com/2015/07/05/st-louis-uber-nada/).

Until then, I will do everything in my power to avoid taxis in St. Louis, and to keep my visiting clients away from taxis. I will pick them up at the airport and drive them wherever they need to go.

Dissovle the Empty See  
Dissolve the Empty See

[Don’t eat at the Pasta House](https://hennessysview.com/2015/07/05/st-louis-uber-nada/)  
And dissolve the Empty See
