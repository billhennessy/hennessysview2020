We got to know Dan Hyatt at an After Party at Sky Music Lounge back in about 2011.

Dan quickly chose a mission for himself: red light and speed cameras. His research and testimony helped build the consensus against the devices.

Dan also championed the cause of municipal court reform with us last year. His researched helped craft the legislation and rally the troops in support of Eric Schmitt's SB-5.

Dan is a true champion of liberty. His election will move Missouri away from rule by entrenched elites and closer to the American ideal.
