Our adopted Ferguson business, the 911 Beauty Salon, appears to have been a target of looters tonight according to KTVI 2.

Dellena Jones's business was already struggling. She didn't need this.

Let's prove that we believe in free enterprise entrepreneurship. That we can help our neighbors.

You can donate to help Dellena on this GoFundMe project
