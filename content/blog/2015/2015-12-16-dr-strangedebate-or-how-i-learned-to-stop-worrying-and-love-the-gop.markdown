“I’ll build a wall . . . and I’ll make Donald Trump pay for it.” — Ted Cruz

Line of the night in the last GOP Presidential debate of the year of our Lord two thousand and fifteen.

This was the most telling debate of all. And it shouldn’t have happened.

The more you know about anything, the less you like it. That’s a scientific fact.

That’s why the "love of your life" when you were dating is the "lump on the couch" 20 years later.

That’s why the Keurig coffee maker you "had to have" last Christmas isn’t your first love this Christmas.

The more we know, the less we like.

Grassroots people want more debates among their candidates. And more debates kill their candidates’ chances.

The Democrats air their few debates on Fridays and Saturdays because they know no one will watch them. They don’t want to be seen.

Democrats know how the brain works. Republicans don’t.

Donald Trump understands this. He actually says very little.

Don’t believe me? Try this.

More information about something  only increases the likelihood you won't like something about it. That's why presidents usually leave office less popular than they entered office.

One hundred debates will expose something you don't like about your favorite candidate.

I'm predicting that candy is more popular than moist, salty, peppermint candy because the people who like moist, salty, peppermint candy must be a subset of people who like candy.

The more information you have, the more likely you object to something. It's pure logic.

These debates are not helping the GOP.

But anyone on the stage tonight would do more to advance the interests of Americans and Western Civilization than any Democrat would. And for that I love the GOP.
