We met[ Dellena Jones during our first Ferguson BUYcott in August.](https://hennessysview.com/2014/08/21/why-st-louis-tea-party-went-to-ferguson-to-shop/) Since then, St. Louis Tea Partier, Dottie Bailey, has made it her mission to help Dellena's business survive and flourish.

Dellena's business has fallen 60 percent since the first riots. She's repaired the damage to her salon, but business is slow.

Despite all her challenges, Dellena still found the time and energy to host Center for Self-Governance training in her shop on a Saturday, foregoing that day's revenue to learn about freedom and responsibility.

[This GoFundMe project ](https://www.gofundme.com/911hairsalonferg)won't clean up the debris around her shop, but it will help her survive until the area gets cleaned up.

We have a goal of raising $20,000 for Dellena, but we need your help.

Here's what you can do today.

[Pledge $1 for every goal the Blues score](https://www.gofundme.com/911hairsalonferg) in their playoff series with Minnesota.

[Pledge $10](https://www.gofundme.com/911hairsalonferg) for every Blues win.
