I hear that Jamie Allman ripped into Senator John Danforth yesterday.

Allman called Danforth a failure and a thug. According to Allman, Danforth's sin was defending a friend against lies, defending a people against centuries-old hate.

I guess Jamie Allman and his handlers like lies and hate.

I'd hate to be Jamie Allman on judgement day.

Just sayin'.

Mourning for Jamie's soul.
