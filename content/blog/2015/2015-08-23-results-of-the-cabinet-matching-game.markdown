A couple weeks ago, I published a simple game for political nerds. Assuming the next president must build a cabinet from current candidates for the Republican nomination for president, how would you assign candidates to cabinet positions.

This was meant to be a fun exercise for people who spend too much time thinking about politics. Like the leaders-eat-last poll, this required hide, often dissatisfying choices. As a result, only six people completed the exercise which took up to a half hour.

Here's the cabinet you put together, using only the top position for candidate:




** Carly Fiorina: Secretary of Commerce
** Ben Carson: Secretary of Health and Human Services
** Jeb Bush: (4-way tie) Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of State, Secretary of Interior, Secretary of Energy
** Ted Cruz: Attorney General
** Rand Paul: Secretary of Treasury
** Marco Rubio: Secretary of Energy
** Scott Walker: Secretary of Labor
** Chris Christie: Secretary of Veterans Affairs
** Mike Huckabee: Secretary of Agriculture
** Donald Trump: Secretary of Treasury
** John Kasich: Secretary of Interior
** George Pataki: Secretary of Trasnportation
** Jim Gilmore: Secretary of Housing and Urban Development
** Bobby Jindal: Secretary of Education
** Lindsey Graham: Secretary of Defense
** Rick Perry: Secretary of Homeland Security
