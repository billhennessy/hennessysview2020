If you read this blog, you have a mile-wide curiosity streak.

Many of you want to know more about Eric Greitens.

You have a great chance to learn more on Saturday, September 26 at 11:00 a.m.

Eric Greitens will have some things to say. Perhaps he won't say everything you want to hear. (It's still 11 months until the primary.) But he'll say things you need to hear.

And that's my favorite thing about Eric. He says what people need to hear instead of merely repeating what polls and pols say you want to hear.

Especially if you're not fully committed to Greitens for Governor, this is a chance to meet a humanitarian, a Rhodes Scholar, a Navy SEAL, a boxing champion, a veterans charity founder, and a best-selling author from St. Louis. Is he a mere "motivational speaker," as some cynical folks suggest, or is he a the leader Missouri needs to climb off the bottom of almost every measure of economic growth? Curious people like you will want to meet him and decide for yourself.

See you on the 26th at Westport.
