Things are getting bad for Hillary.

I hear she's losing a lot of support from Democrat Party insiders, at least in private. The DNC is meeting this week, and  talk will likely surround an alternative Democrats can vote for.

While Republicans enjoy the Clinton meltdown, we might want to be careful what we wish for.

One of the GOP's best hopes for the White House is voter enthusiasm. Republicans can't wait to vote, Democrats dread it. Voter enthusiasm influences turnout. A crippled Hillary probably won't fire up Democrats, boosting Republican chances in races from the White House to school boards.

But another candidate might--or combination of candidates--might fire up the Democrats.

**Suppose Joe Biden declares and immediately announces Senator Elizabeth Warren as his running mate**. Biden would commit to serving only term. He would run to heal divisions with Congress. He knows how to get along with Republicans.

Meanwhile, the left would have their dream candidate as Veep and a shoe-in to take over the top of the ticket in 2020.

**Biden-Warren would fix the Democrats' voter enthusiasm problem** in an instant.

Meanwhile, if Donald Trump goes on to win the Republican nomination, the Biden-Warren ticket might cruise into the White House.

I could be wrong, but **I think America will tire of Donald Trump's act**. That fatigue could hit before Iowa or after November. But I bet it hits, and hard. High-intensity, overbearing people exhaust others, and Americans are weary already.

If Trump strings together early wins, it's possible the primary race will dwindle to Trump and Bush--the two with the money to hang on til the convention. With that choice for Republicans, Democrat enthusiasm would probably hit record highs. If we experience[ another financial meltdown](https://hennessysview.com/2015/08/24/quick-note-on-market/), the press will demand Warren on the ticket. And the GOP will be down to Trump or Bush. ([Never count Bush out](https://hennessysview.com/2015/08/18/whos-really-left-in-the-gop-field/).)

Charles [Krauthammer worries about this scenario](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2015/08/25/krauthammer_a_biden-warren_ticket_would_be_perfect_for_democrats_ensure_12_years_of_liberal_rule.html), too.

Transcript:



> He has an age issue which is if he were sworn in on inauguration day he'd be the oldest president by five years. With Warren, and if you announce you are going to be a one-termer, nobody is going to want to elect you. But if you have you as your heir, he gets the entire base, the liberals have a vision of a 12-year rule, it would work perfectly for them.



Look, I love seeing Clintons in political agony. And [I can find good in the Trump message](https://hennessysview.com/2015/08/24/trump-good-bad-and-ugly/). But we need to be careful what we wish for. Biden-Warren would be a disaster for America.
