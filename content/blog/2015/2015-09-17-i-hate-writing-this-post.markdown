I like to say [I hate electoral politics](https://hennessysview.com/2015/09/16/i-am-honored-to-question-the-gop-candidates-for-you-and-heritage/).

Maybe I just want people to _think_ I'm the kind of person who hates electoral politics. (We are all capable of being wrong about ourselves.)

I have to say, briefly, that this was the most encouraging Republican debate since . . . 1980? These are all serious people, and I'm including Trump. They all love America, and not just what they might get from America. Ya know, like the Clintons. These people love America **the way I do**.

I have no criticism worth writing about on style or substance of any of them. That's not to say I agree with isolationism or interventionism or the war on drugs or banning vaccines or minimum wage laws, etc. But nothing anyone said is worth attacking in writing. Even the stuff Bush said.

I do have ONE criticism for Tapper's questions. Every question was intended to start a fight between two or more people on stage, and most of them took the bait. Ben Carson, Chris Christie, John Kasich, and Mike Huckabee refused. All the others took the bait.

Ladies and gentlemen: stop taking the damn bait.

Now, the positives which trump the negatives by orders of magnitude.

I tweeted that I like all of these people more after tonight. In fact, after the first hour, I found myself rooting for all of them. All of them. I was rooting for Jeb Bush and for Donald Trump. I silently stood and clapped Carly Fiorina and John Kasich and, especially, Marco Rubio. Ted Cruz's presentation issues faded as he tired which tells me he needs to get less sleep; his positions are spotless. Ben Carson's humble decency makes me so proud and hopeful for America. Mike Huckabee--who has a lot of issues issues--is my favorite advocate for the issues we agree on. Scott Walker game across as a serious, intelligent man, tonight. Chris Christie's attacks on Obama and support of American strength were sincere and important.

I hope and pray that America watched this debate. I hope and pray that young people watched. If they did, they saw 10 men and one remarkable woman who have put their entire lives in the public eye for the right to give us a better life--but only if **we** are willing to step up and **live** a better life.

My God, how refreshing!

I am prouder now than at any time since 9/11 or maybe the Reagan years.

Bravo, GOP. You have some wonderful people who want to lead and reform the greatest nation in the history of the world.

So, why do I hate writing this post? Because I sound like a GOP fan boy. But[ I am only being honest](https://hennessysview.com/2015/09/16/i-am-honored-to-question-the-gop-candidates-for-you-and-heritage/).
