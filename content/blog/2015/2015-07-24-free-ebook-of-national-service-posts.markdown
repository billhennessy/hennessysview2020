My series on National Service is important. Maybe not urgent, but important. (See Eisenhower Square.)
So I turned it into an eBook:

Be warned: I did not edit the posts, so the ebook contains all the links to previous posts in the series. If there's interest, I'll go back and clean it up. This is just for convenience.

Thanks.
