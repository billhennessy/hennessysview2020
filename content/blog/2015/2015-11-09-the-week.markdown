### Ben Carson



The press can't find people who will corroborate Ben Carson's low opinion of himself as a young man. And somehow we're supposed to believe that reflect poorly on Dr. Carson. It reflects poorly on journalism, for sure, but it actually shows that people who knew Dr. Carson won't speak ill of him. Nice problem to have.



### Weather



Was the weather wonderful this weekend, or what? I hope you got out, even if just to do some yard work. The week ahead looks delightful, too.



### GOP Debate



[Fox Business News hosts this week's Republican debate](https://www.foxbusiness.com/industries/2015/11/05/fox-business-networkwsj-gop-candidate-debate-lineup-announced/?intcmp=marketfeatures). Which Donald Trump will show up? The undercard is at 6PM CST with the main event at 8PM CST. Only eight participants made the prime time fight: Trump, Carson, Rubio, Cruz, Bush, Fiorina, Kasich, and Paul.



### Economy



Last week's labor report showed that the largest growing job in America is giving up finding a job. Meanwhile, the CEO of the world's largest shipping company, Maersk, says the [global economy is far worse than central bankers claim](https://www.businessinsider.com/moeller-maersk-ceo-says-global-growth-worse-than-expected-2015-11), based on major slowdowns in shipping, rail, and truck transportation. International trade organization [OECD confirms Maersk's concerns](https://www.businessinsider.com/oecd-trade-figures-deeply-concerning-could-lead-to-global-recession-2015-11).



### St. Louis Blues



The Blues look dangerous. Rookie defenseman [Colton Parayko](https://blues.nhl.com/club/player.htm?id=8476892) has five goals, all game-winners. Parayko plays fearlessly at both ends of the ice, attacking the offensive corners and net like a winger while clearing his own crease like Noel Piccard. Watch this kid. Next game is Tuesday at 6:00.
