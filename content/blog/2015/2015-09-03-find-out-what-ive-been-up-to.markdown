Sorry for the dearth of posts.

You know I have a day job. Sometimes that day job becomes a night job. And a weekend job, too.

That's happened.

I'm still keeping up on what's going on in the world, but travel and software launches and strategic plans have me spinning.

I like to write when I have a long periods of uninterrupted time. Well, those blocks of time have been few and far between.

I should get back to the blog in a couple of weeks. Until then, please read [The Conservative Heart by Arthur C. Brooks](https://amzn.to/1LWhKqa). Because a change in national mood will blow in soon, and [**The Conservative Heart**](https://amzn.to/1LWhKqa) provides the blueprint to owning the next era.
