You might have noticed that [my report on the Speaker election process lacked enthusiasm](https://hennessysview.com/2015/01/05/heres-mere-mortal-becomes-speaker-house/).

Now you know why.

Boehner is moving quickly to purge conservatives from all committees of meaning. He has vowed to cooperate with the White House and Democrats. He has vowed never to shut down government again, no matter how evil, onerous, or destructive of liberty government becomes.

Boehner has gone full native.

That's a predictable outcome of a failed coup. The conspirators get whacked. Heads are rolling already: From Politco:

That's right. With a majority this big, let's give Obama everything he wants.

Here's my favorite line from [Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/boehner-allies-out-for-revenge-114007.html#ixzz3O6aZ3vI3):



> Boehner’s allies have thirsted for this kind of action from the speaker, who say he’s let people walk all over him for too long and is too nice to people who are eager to stab him in the back.



Yeah. Like the President.

While we wait for the great GOP majority to destroy itself, half the Capitol, and the economy, let's prepare for 2016.
