News of Auditor Tom Schweich's death hit me hard. If you haven't heard, [St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported to day that my friend Tom Schweich died of a gunshot wound](https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/missouri-auditor-and-governor-candidate-tom-schweich-has-died/article_879ddcd7-c997-5df3-bc61-39282c4f7434.html) today. Tom was 54.

I am saddened by this news. I pray for Tom's family and for his rapid entry to eternal happiness.

May perpetual light shine on him, and may his soul and all the souls of all the faithful departed rest in peace.
