I'll make this brief.

If we must respect (revere?) the erstwhile Bruce Jenner for self-identifying as a woman, we have to respect Rachel Dolezal for self-identifying as black.

Both voluntarily left the world of privilege, as it were, to join an underclass--an identifiable minority. Jenner left manhood; Dolezal left whitehood.

The left doesn't see it that way, though. Apparently, rejecting one's biological sex is okay, but rejecting one's biological race isn't.

My advice to Caitlyn Jenner: stop at sex. If you decide you're black, all that goodwill you're feeling will disappear.

Because hypocrisy is Greek for progressive.
