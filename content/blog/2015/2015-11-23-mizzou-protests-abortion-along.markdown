I hate to say "I told you so."

But the St. Louis Post Dispatch has found that [I may have been right on November 8](https://hennessysview.com/2015/11/08/are-abortionists-manipulating-mizzous-black-athletes/). That's when I made the outlandish comment that **the whole race issue at Mizzou is actually an abortion issue.** I suspected that Planned Parenthood's vast lobbyist network is agitating leaders of left-leaning organizations trying to create general unrest.

**The manipulators would use campus racial unrest to demand restored privileges for Planned Parenthood. **

Lo and behold,[ from stltoday.com](https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/mizzou-students-putting-pressure-on-university-to-continue-relationship-with/article_2a3208e2-9328-519f-bc9a-b28ab7cd1330.html):



> When the University of Missouri Board of Curators abruptly [dismissed R. Bowen Loftin](https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/missteps-not-student-revolt-led-to-mizzou-chancellor-s-demise/article_f955e9cf-6fc8-5fb0-b2cc-1b798d53fccc.html) as University of Missouri-Columbia chancellor on Nov. 9, some Mizzou students and **abortion-rights supporters saw an opportunity to try to reverse a controversial university decision.**

They have begun a campaign seeking to pressure Mizzou Interim Chancellor Hank Foley to reconsider Loftin’s decision to [eliminate a category of clinical privilege](https://www.stltoday.com/business/local/planned-parenthood-looks-for-alternative-privileging-options/article_9374fe04-8483-5497-b5eb-76c73a5a69f5.html) at the university’s hospital that is likely to end the ability of women to get abortions in Columbia after the end of this month.



There you have it. **Concerned Student 1950 is nothing more than  Planned Parenthood's bitch**, churning up some fetuses for the abortion mill, and carrying out the eugenicists' dream of a world free from the plague of inferior breeding.
