In the war on terror, you’re on our side or theirs.

Barack Obama announced that [he will veto any attempt by Congress to require background checks of Syrian refugees in an attempt to weed out ISIS terrorists](https://www.businessinsider.com/r-white-house-says-obama-would-veto-proposal-for-more-scrutiny-of-refugees-2015-11). **The President's allegiances are now clear**.

I heard Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) say that [we must ensure proper screening](https://www.wjbc.com/2015/11/17/durbin-concerned-about-how-to-screen-syrian-refugees/) in the wake of last Friday’s Islamic terrorist attack in Paris.

The [House of Representatives is working on legislation](https://www.theblaze.com/stories/2015/11/18/house-gop-moves-on-urgent-effort-to-strengthen-vetting-of-syrian-refugees-speaker-ryan-promises-no-religious-test/) to do just that: increase the likelihood that we will catch terrorist infiltraters before they reach American soil.

**But Barack Obama wants none of it.**

Barack Obama wants the **floodgates open**.

Barack **Obama has allegiances **the American people, our traditions, and our institutions do not share.

**It’s time for responsible Democrats to choose sides**. Ours or theirs. America's or his.

We are not on Obama’s side, and he he is not on ours.
