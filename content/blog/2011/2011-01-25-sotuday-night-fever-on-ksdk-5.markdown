I’ll participate on KSDK Channel 5’s post-SOTU discussion panel Tuesday following the State of the Union speech. (I being Bill Hennessy, in case you’re reading this from a news feed.)

 

I don’t know who my fellow panelists will be, but I think it’s pretty cool that a local network invited a tea partier to help break down the President’s State of the Union speech. 

 

The speech starts at 8:00 p.m. CT Tuesday, January 25 on [KSDK 5](https://www.ksdk.com/). The analysis follows.

 

Please tune in and tell your friends. (Tweet, Facebook, email a link to this post, using the buttons below.)

 

**Other ideas to make the evening more meaningful:**

* Do a shot every time Barry says “perfectly clear”*


 

* Draw a picture of Nancy Pelosi when John Boehner announces the President

 

* Have your kids interrupt with applause every time you say something really, really witty at the TV

 

* In the comments below, post the snarky answers I should have given instead of the lame, unintelligible responses I actually give
