Judy Ancel is the University of Kansas City instructor responsible for teaching students to use violence, sabotage and intimidation as political tools. She’s telling the Kansas City Star that she’s receiving threats from people upset that she teaches students to threaten others.

I oppose violence, sabotage, and intimidation as political tools.  But Judy Ancel’s message of violence seems to have gotten through to some people.

Too bad Ancel doesn’t use her skills for good[ instead of evil](https://www.missourieducationwatchdog.com/2011/04/is-sacrificing-cats-to-achieve-labor.html).
