The headline on July 15 was knee-slapping funny:



> **Obama says he’s “**[**ready to move**](https://www.nasdaq.com/aspx/stock-market-news-story.aspx?storyid=201107151142dowjonesdjonline000414&title=obama-says-ready-to-moveon-raising-debt-ceiling)**” on debt ceiling. **



Really?  The man who [dug a deeper debt hole in two years than anyone else](https://www.cnsnews.com/node/72404) did in 8—or 15—is _willing_ to borrow more?

For those who believe Obama’s some sort of deficit hawk, let’s take a quick stroll down memory.




  1. Obama wanted to increase the debt limit by $2.5 trillion in April, and he want _no conditions_ on that increase.  In April 2011, **Barack Obama opposed any measures to reduce federal spending**.
  2. **Obama refused to produce a plan**. Period. He has no plan for reducing debt. He has no plan for eliminating deficits. He has no plan for creating jobs or helping small business.  He has no plan for anything but golf and party.




3.  **Obama says 80 percent of Americans demand a tax increase**, though he is incapable of citing any source for that number. In other words, he made it up.

**Of course Obama’s ready to move on borrowing more money**.  Borrowing is his only plan. His credit card is maxed out, and he wants the limit raised.

Only, this time, there are men and women in Congress who more beholden to the Millennial generation than to Boomers. Like a good banker, this** Congress wants the borrower to produce a debt reduction plan before lending another penny**.

I’m glad Obama’s finally ready to move on something besides a tee box.  But I won’t be completely satisfied until he moves out of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
