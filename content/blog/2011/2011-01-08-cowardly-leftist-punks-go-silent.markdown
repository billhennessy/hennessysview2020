The tragedy in Tucson exposed America’s leading leftists for what they are.

 

[Andrew Breitbart](https://twitter.com/#!/AndrewBreitbart) points out on Twitter that his cowardly leftist accusors, including Markos Moulitsas and Eric Boehlert, quieted down on their libelous attacks on Breitbart, Palin, Bush, and Tea Party.

 

These leftist cowards shut up only after it became undeniably clear that the evil bastard who shot Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and 11 others is not a tea partier, but a deranged socialist. Whatever Jarod Lee Loughner’s politics are, they seem a lot closer to Moulitsas and Boelhert and Chris Matthews and Matt Yglesias than to Breitbart or me. 

 

Am I saying that those leftist cowards are responsible for the horror in Tucson? No. I’m saying they are cowards who use murder and misery to advance their collectivist politics by libelously blaming those who stand for liberty.
