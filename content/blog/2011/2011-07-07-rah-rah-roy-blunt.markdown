Roy Blunt has not given an inch in the[ battle over the debt ceiling](https://blunt.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/news?ContentRecord_id=5f89c035-3ba3-4c5b-93bd-5709588604c1). He deserves high praise for his resolve.

During the 2010 Republican primary, many on the right questioned Blunt's fiscal conservative credentials.  As a member of the House, Blunt had helped craft some and pass unpopular spending bills, including TARP.  **On the[ issue of debt and responsibility](https://ozarksfirst.com/fulltext?nxd_id=457687), though, he shows no sign of cracking.**

](https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/roy_Blunt_rep_27.jpg)Government debt is the defining issue of our time, perhaps of the American experiment. As Congressman Todd Akin warns, the consequences of kicking the can down the road could be as devastating as the Civil War.

**I personally thank Senator Blunt and his fellow Republicans for treating this grave issue with the seriousness it deserves.**  We are quick to attack when a politician disappoints, but are we willing to applaud when t hey do right?

**Please drop Senator Blunt an [email](https://blunt.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/contact-form?p=contact)**thanking him for his courage and asking to remaining vigilant in this fight for our future. He's under attack from the communists, and he deserves our support.

I just left a voice mail for Senator Blunt. Please contact him via phone, fax, or [email](https://blunt.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/contact). And leave a comment below or on Twitter when you're done.
