"I will die fighting this Democrat-Media Complex, and I will fight alongside you."

](https://19015-hennessysview.hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/breitbartMoveOnUp.jpg)That's Andrew Breitbart's commitment to African-American conservatives meeting at the Crowne Plaza Hotel at the airport in St. Louis, Missouri, yesterday.

The three-day "Meet Me in the 'Lou" conference is the work of the remarkable people at [MoveOnUp.org](https://moveonup.ning.com/).  Today's day two, and Breitbart is the luncheon speaker.

MoveOnUp.org represents the people that the Civil Rights Industry never wants you to meet: black conservatives, escapees from what Star Parker calls "Uncle Sam's Plantation."  (Star Parker was the headline speaker at the evening's [Sherman Thompson Parker Scholarship Banquet.](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2011/08/star-parker-shines-at-move-on-up-org-annual-conference-in-st-louis/))

What frightens the left about MoveOnUp.org is their independence.  Real independence.  The independence that exists only in educated minds that refuse to bow down to their racial overlords.

"How will you feel," said Shelby Emmett, "when you're children or grandchildren ask, 'Mom, tell me what it was like when we were

free.'" Shelby, a Detroit native now working in Maryland, won a roomful of fans and a mountain of respect at her morning breakout session. I [follow her blog about the Constitution in the 21st Century](https://constitution21st.blogspot.com/).

Brietbart continues.  "They don't care what happens in the inner city . . . as long as _you_ vote Democrat."

[Stacy Swimp, president of The Frederick Douglass Society of Michigan](https://frederickdouglassfoundationofmichigan.blogspot.com/) (soon going national) also spoke in a morning breakout. His personal tale mirrors the hopes of MoveOnUp.org.  With the help of a strong Christian faith, he pulled himself out of the bogs of statist limitations and victimology.  He refused to live as a slave to a decaying social norm. Stacy adopted Frederick Douglass's determination to "go as a man and not as a slave."

Other remarkable speakers included Cherylyn Harley LeBon on immigration policy and Kenneth McClenton of American Conservative Party.

After Breitbart's luncheon speech, which ended with a 3 minute standing ovation, we met some local lefties in the lobby for conversation.   But that's a story for later . . .
