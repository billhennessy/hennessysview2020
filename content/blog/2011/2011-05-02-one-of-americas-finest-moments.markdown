Over 6,000 American and 10,000 allied warriors gave their lives as a result of Bin Laden's evil. These nn addition to the 3,000 who died 9/11 and the tens of thousands of others who've died at Bin Laden's hand. 

Since Ollie North's testimony to Congress during the Iran-Contra Hearings in the Reagan Administration, we've been working toward this one man's death. 

This is a pivotal moment in US and world history. After a spate of hurried terrorism attacks to prove they can still act, I expect Islamic terrorism to recede toward the dust bin of history where it belongs.

We may never know the name of the sniper whose bullet carried Bin Laden's wretched soul to the gates of Hell, but I'm about to down a shot of Maker’s Mark to his good name. His, and every American who’s served since 9/11. 

This is one of America's finest moments.
