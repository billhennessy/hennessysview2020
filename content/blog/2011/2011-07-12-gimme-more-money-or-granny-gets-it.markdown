Obama showed his breaking point today. The stress got to him. 

Today [Obama threatened to stop Social Security payments](https://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20078789-503544.html) if Congress doesn’t bend to his will on the debt ceiling. 

The president told reporters that there may not be enough money to pay Social Security benefits on and after August 3rd. 

But the President lies.

[Revenue from taxes and other fees](https://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/2747108/posts) would cover Social Security and other payments. What won’t be covered is additional borrowing to service the country’s already outrageous debt. 

In desperation, Obama put a gun to the heads of the elderly.

Smart. Very smart.
