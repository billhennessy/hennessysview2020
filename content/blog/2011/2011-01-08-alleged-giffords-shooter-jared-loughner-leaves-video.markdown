Update: [Gateway Pundit](https://gatewaypundit.rightnetwork.com/) has [much more on the alleged shooter.](https://gatewaypundit.rightnetwork.com/2011/01/shooter-jarod-laughner/)

 

These appear to be the paranoid ramblings of the man in custody for shooting Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and 11 others, [including a federal judge](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/01/federal-judge-john-roll-among-victims-in-arizona-congresswoman-shooting/?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Feed:+abovethelaw+(Above+the+Law)&utm_content=Google+Feedfetcher), in Tucson, AZ. Lots of hard left references in his favorite books, including _Mein Kampf_ and _The Communist Manifesto_. Politico’s Ben Smith calls [Laughner’s writings “socialist](https://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0111/Alleged_shooter_left_social_media_hints.html).”

Another Video by alleged shooter in Arizona made 3 weeks before shooting

 

This stuff is beyond me. Fodder for the criminal psychologists.

 

Sick. 

 

<strike>Note: Correct last name is “Laughner” not “Loughner” as I originally posted. Sorry. His first name has appears as both Jerod and Jarod. This should settle out shortly as we learn more.</strike>

 

AND we’re back to Loughner. (I should have trusted his own [Myspace page](https://www.businessinsider.com/jared-lee-loughner-2011-1) which has since been removed.)

 

UPDATES:

 

1. A woman claiming to be a [classmate of Jarod Lee Loughner’s](https://www.businessinsider.com/woman-who-says-she-went-to-school-with-alleged-shooter-says-he-met-giffords-in-2007-2011-1) describes the alleged murderer as a “leftist” “anti-flag”
