That’s St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley. 

 

It’s bad enough that corruption, nepotism, and Machiavellian favoritism runs rampant in St. Louis County. What’s worse is that Dooley doesn’t seem to care what anyone thinks.

Enough? There’s more. With Dooley, there’s always more.

 

John Temporiti’s daughter is also a County employee, and Temporiti has a history of confronting people who don’t do as he says.

 

There’s probably not much we can do right now about Dooley’s corruption and the [Temporiti’s rather unique employment agency](https://www.24thstate.com/2011/03/mike-temporitis-job-qaulifications-nepotism-and-patronage.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+24thstate+%2824thstate%29) at 41 South Central in Clayton. But we can slow down Dooley’s corruption machine on April 5.

 

That’s date Dooley hopes to coronate yet another political hack, Jake Zimmerman, as County Assessor.

 

You have the chance to upend the Dooley Regime by electing L. K. “Chip” Wood as County Assessor.

 

[Chip Wood](https://www.chipwoodforassessor.com/index1.html) is an outstanding candidate whose entire life has revolved around real estate and property. While Zimmerman has promised to make you talk to a computer if you don’t like your assessment, Wood will let you deal with a human being who is personally responsible for your case. 

 

In fact, everything about Dooley screams “machine.” The alternative is human, and the very personable Chip Wood.

 

You can trust Chip to keep assessments fair.
