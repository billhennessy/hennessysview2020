Answer: Bondbonds.

Sometimes the only option is humor.  Maybe it’s time to laugh . . . at ourselves, at our pre-occupations, and at our president.

We elected him. And, in a republic, you always get the leadership you deserve.

Now what?

Now focus. Public displays of anger only hurt us. Anger is a tactic.

Yes, I’m angry. Furious. But acting out on anger does us no good.  Instead, wise men and women **focus that anger into a steely resolve to electorally destroy the cretins that destroyed America’s credit rating, liberty, and economy**.

What makes United States Marines, Rangers, Delta Force, SEALs, an the like so deadly is not bloodlust . . . it’s discipline.  Had an angry mob descended on Usama’s compound in May, he’d be alive and the mod would be dead.

**Steely determination** to electorally destroy.  Lacking that discipline will hurt the cause.

The next meeting is [September 15 at 7:00 at Crowne Plaza Hotel in Clayton](https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=200026046720114).  Please bring a cold, steely resolve.  But leave room for a warm smile for friends.
