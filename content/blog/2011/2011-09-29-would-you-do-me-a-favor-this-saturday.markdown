I try not to ask for much.  Okay, maybe that’s not true, but I’m going to ask you a favor, anyway. Mark this down:  **7:00 pm, Saturday, October 1.  **

It’s weird, I know.  But I’m asking for three presents in one.

First, my mom and dad celebrate their wedding anniversary this week. (62nd?)  Second, my wife and I celebrate our wedding anniversary this week.  Third, next week is my birthday.

I’d ask for a birthday party, but I know you’ll all be worn out from[ the big Forest Park event on Tuesday, October 4 at 5:00 pm](https://stlouisteaparty.com/2011/09/27/event-who-else-wants-a-windmill-rally/).

So I’m going to ask you for a very simple favor.

**Please watch **[**KPLR Channel 11**](https://www.kplr11.com/)** at 7:00 pm this Saturday, October 1.  If you can’t watch, DVR it and watch later.**

See, I’ll be on. I’m the guest on a brand new news program hosted by Shirley Washington. Panelists include Charles Jaco and Betsey Bruce. (It could be lively!)

The format sounds great: a 15-minute regular news section followed by a 45-minute examination of one topic. So don’t stop watching if it’s straight news at the top of the hour.  Pop some popcorn, crack open a Bud Select, and relax.

Thanks to your work, **the topic of the very first episode is the Tea Party Movement**.

Since we couldn’t get all 7,000+ people registered in our database into the studio, they asked me to be your humble representative.  I hope I don’t let you down.

**So please watch or DVR Saturday at 7, Channel 11.  And drop a nice note to **[**Shirley Washington to thank her**](mailto:shirley.washington@tvstl.com/)** for making Tea Party the first topic. **
