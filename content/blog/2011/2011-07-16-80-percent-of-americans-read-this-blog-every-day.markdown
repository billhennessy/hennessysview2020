I’ll be honest with you: I’ve lied. 

Usually out of desperation. I’ve lied to those closest to me—those most willing to forgive the thing I lied about. 

I’ve also told the truth to my own detriment. In the long run, the latter works best. In fact, telling the truth works best in the short run, too. 

So maybe Obama’s desperate. Maybe he knows that the debt ceiling debate is the beginning of the unraveling of Americum Sovieticum, his life-long dream. In desperation, then, he’s simply making stuff up. 

**How do I know Obama’s lying?**

](https://www.carolinapatriots.org/)**The last time 80 percent of America agreed on something**, the question was whether or not to [get baby Jessica McClure out of the well](https://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20193651,00.html). So when I hear that 80 percent of Americans support something, I assume it involves human life. 

But somewhere, somehow, Barack Obama has found data revealing that 80 percent of Americans want—_demand_—a tax increase.

**For the life of me, I cannot find these people. **

I can find [this Rasmussen poll indicating that 55 percent oppose](https://www.newsmax.com/InsideCover/Rasmussen-debt-deal-55percent/2011/07/14/id/403603)__ a tax increase as part of a debt ceiling package. 

I can also find a [Gallup poll that finds only 32 percent](https://www.gallup.com/poll/148472/Deficit-Americans-Prefer-Spending-Cuts-Open-Tax-Hikes.aspx) would agree to tax increases as part of a deal.

Maybe the President saw this [Quinnipiac University poll](https://www.quinnipiac.edu/x1295.xml?ReleaseID=1624) – with a questioned designed to elicit a particular response. The question enticed 62 percent of 2,311 registered voters to accept some taxes on the wealthiest Americans. 

So, perhaps, Obama merely took that 62 and round up to the nearest . . . 80?

**But there’s also the media defensive panic.**

When conservative presidents are caught lying or being morons, conservatives tend to admit, well, maybe he shouldn’t have said “mission accomplished.” 

When leftists find their leftist president being a deceitful dolt, they obfuscate. Huffington Post, New York Times—all the usual suspects—have scrubbed their sites of references to the President’s lie. (At least, my searches found nothing. Then, again, I try to not to spend too much time on those sites.)

Instead, the left talks about this being the time to bring taxes into the equation. 

**Two people who get it . . . clearly: Mark Steyn and Charles Krauthammer. **

Steyn, as usual, picks apart the stupid in “[No Bargaining With Obluffer](https://www.ocregister.com/opinion/government-308436-debt-year.html).”

[Krauthammer destroys Obama’s credibility](https://www.investors.com/NewsAndAnalysis/Article/578331/201107141838/Regime-Change-May-Be-Needed-To-Cut-Deficit.htm) by pointing to Obama’s long and recent history of demanding more debt at any cost. 



>   How about last December, when he ignored his own debt commission's recommendations? How about February, when he presented a budget that increases debt by $10 trillion over the next decade? How about April, when he sought a debt-ceiling increase with zero debt reduction attached?    
> 
> All of a sudden he's a born-again budget balancer prepared to bravely take on his own party by making deep cuts in entitlements. Really? Name one.

So I lied again. Eighty percent of Americans don’t read [Hennessy’s View](https://hennessysview.com/) every day. Not yet, anyway.
