What would _you_ do?

 

Suppose you did something stupid. You blamed the wrong person, for instance, for a capital crime. Then supposed one of your comrades compounded your . . . error . . . by threatening to kill someone on national television?

](https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/BillMaherAngry1.jpg)If you’re an American leftist, you might double down by issuing even _more_ death threats to even _more_ people. 

 

That’s what’ happening right now in America. Death threats are pouring into Trent Humphries, Tucson Tea Party organizer, [Dana Loesch](https://teapartyfi.com/news/Dana-Loesch-Gets-Death-Threats-in-Wake-of-Arizona-Shooting-1859628.html), [Sarah Palin (who vows not to be silenced)](https://michellemalkin.com/2011/01/17/shut-me-up/), [Glenn Beck](https://www.mediaite.com/tv/glenn-beck-opens-up-about-violence-i-have-15-operating-threats-on-me-at-any-given-time/), and more. The self-proclaimed conscience of America—collectivist lefists—have essentially declared war on the right.

 

[Gateway Pundit](https://gatewaypundit.rightnetwork.com/) and the [St. Louis Tea Party Coalition issued a press release](https://gatewaypundit.rightnetwork.com/2011/01/st-louis-tea-party-stands-in-solidarity-with-trent-humphries-and-the-tucson-tea-party/) on January 17 denouncing the left’s continued threat of violence as means of advancing its anti-liberty agenda.

 

To counter the left’s increasing vitriol and violence, please publicly thank three people today. 

 

I’ll start:

 

Thank you, Jim Hoft, for bringing to our attention the mounting threats Trent Humphries is receiving. 

 

Thank you, Jen Ennenbach for crafting a great press release on the issues.

 

Thank you, Dana Loesch, for continuing to keep our voices in the national ear.

 

And a bonus: thank you for honoring by reading my little web missives.

 

*UPDATE* [J. Eric Fuller issues apology](https://www.cnn.com/2011/POLITICS/01/17/arizona.shooting.fuller/index.html) to Trent Humphries.
