**Book Description**

**New from Broadside Books' Voices of the Tea Party.** In _[Weaving the Roots](https://www.harpercollins.com/books/Weaving-Roots/?isbn=9780062112965)_, you'll learn how even tiny grassroots organizations can make big impacts on the world through smart use of free or inexpensive social media tools.

First you'll learn the major tools, like Facebook, twitter, LinkedIn, Google Buzz, blogging, talk radio, and SMS text. How they work, how they work together, and how you can maximize your impact with a small team.

Next, you'll explore five key activities for social networking and which tools work best: recruiting, informing, activating, advocating, coordinating

Finally, you'll find out the science behind social media. You'll get answers to questions that many don't know to ask, like what time of day to tweet or post on Facebook, which day of the week is best for which social channel, and how to announce an event to get lots of attendees without lots of time-consuming questions.

Available May 31, 2011, but you can pre-order today.
