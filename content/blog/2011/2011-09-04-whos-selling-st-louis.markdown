Aerotropolis is a pretty [obvious attempt to shift tax money](https://www.24thstate.com/2011/06/mckee-tropolis.html) into the pockets of Jefferson City favorites.  It's an example of [crony capitalism at its worst](https://hennessysview.com/?s=aerotropolis&submit.x=0&submit.y=0).

Now,[ KMOV Channel 4's Craig Cheatham](https://www.kmov.com/news/local/Selling-St-Louis-129125098.html) shines the light on the people buying and selling St. Louis in this series.  Not just Aerotropolis, but the whole oligarchy of incompetent, corrupt, and self-serving Boss Hog-types who seem bent on reducing the St. Louis region to irrelevance.



Paul McKee is the developer who puts a lot of tax payer dollars at risk while pocketing the profits if and when they materialize.

This 6-part series gives you a good idea of why the St. Louis region is bleeding jobs and people.

 The Special Session starts Tuesday, September 6, in Jefferson City.  It's our last chance to tell our legislators to drop Aerotropolis before we drop them.
