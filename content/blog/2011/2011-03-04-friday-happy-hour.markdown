Dana Loesch on facebook gave kudos to Missouri State Senators [Nieves](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=830523218) and [Lembke](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1789213453) for fighting a federal bribe to the states.

They're standing their ground against some of their fellow GOP who need to be reminded what fiscal conservatism is. Bravo.

I join Dana. For the second time this year, these two have stood guard against more federal borrowing against my kids.

 

**ACTION:**

 

Please call or write the Senators to thank them for their principled courage. And if you don’t have the good fortune of living in one of their districts, [call or write your Senator](https://www.senate.mo.gov/llookup/leg_lookup.aspx) and asking him or her to join Nieves and Lembke in their fight against Washington bribes.
