](https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/GailHackett.jpg)Gail Hackett, UMKC Provost, [released a deceitful, false, and irresponsible defense of UMKC instructors](https://stlouis.cbslocal.com/2011/04/28/umsl-investigates-whether-class-promotes-violence/) who encouraged students to use violence, sabotage, and intimidation to their way. 

But [Gail Hackett refuses to answer hard questions](https://www.umkc.edu/provost/about/). 

I have one question for the UMKC Provost: ****

**Do you agree with Don Giljum’s statement “I believe in a violent overthrow of Bourgeois?” **

Before you answer, remember that Giljum’s use of the personal term “Bourgois” instead of the the class “bourguoisie” indicates that Giljim believes in violence against individual members of the middle class. 

In other words, Giljum – and by extension UMKC and UMSL – encourage students to violently attack middle class people. 

Your answer?
