](https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/herman-cain.jpg)Herman Cain is riding a wave of popularity because of his [upset win in the Florida straw poll](https://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/herman-cain-wins-presidency-5-straw-poll/1193524) on Saturday.  He’s helped by [Rick Perry’s free-fall](https://hennessysview.com/white-house/what-rick-perry-can-learn-from-clark-griswold/) and Mitt Romney’s establishmentarianism.  But Cain is a huge underdog.

That’s okay because **America _loves_ an underdog. **

Here’s what must happen _right now_ for Herman Cain to win:

1.  **Social Media** avalanche.  Get @THEHermanCain trending on Twitter, and keep it there for five consecutive days. How?  Simple. Use Hootsuite (or similar tool) to schedule _original_ tweets about Herman Cain, with a shortened link to his site ([https://bit.ly/r19euz](https://bit.ly/r19euz)) and his Twitter handle (@THEHermanCain).  Send 2 original tweets per day—one in the morning, one in the evening.  Post about Herman Cain, with link to his site ([https://bit.ly/r19euz](https://bit.ly/r19euz)) on Facebook every other day (no more). (For more tips on effective social media campaigning, get my $1.99 ebook “[Weaving the Roots](https://www.harpercollins.com/books/Weaving-Roots/?isbn=9780062112965).”)

2.  **Bloggers** posting human stories about why Florida voters picked Cain.  Real stories like [this one from Byron York](https://campaign2012.washingtonexaminer.com/article/how-cain-won-florida):



> "I liked Cain, but I wasn't sure he could win," said Zena, from Washington County.  "But after I heard this, I thought it doesn't matter if he wins or not -- I am for this man. He was awesome."



Or this one from the same York piece:



> "I couldn't make up my mind," said Thelma, from Panama City, after the vote.  "It was the speech that made the hair stand up on my arms.  It wasn't a tingle down my leg -- it was an emotional excitement that this man knows how to get our country out of trouble."



3.  **Add a link** to Herman Cain’s official website to your email signature. This is a powerful tool that everyone who sends emails can use.

4.  **Attend a local event**.  You’ll need to sign up for email blasts from the Cain campaign ([https://bit.ly/r19euz](https://bit.ly/r19euz)) and read them. But don’t just read them. Forward important ones to 5 friends.  (Only important ones. Don’t spam the undecided.)

5.  **Donate Money**.  I know conservatives and independents hate the idea of money in politics. Without money, Cain cannot compete.  I’ll say it again:  without millions of small donations, Herman Cain will lose.  Of all five must-do actions on this list, this is the most important.  Give whatever you can, then tell the world, “I just donated to Herman Cain online [https://bit.ly/r19euz](https://bit.ly/r19euz)."

In 2008, the Republicans nominated John McCain—an echo.  In 1996, Republicans nominated Bob Dole—an echo.  In 1988, 2000, and 2004 Republicans nominated echoes. (Did I say “Republicans?”  I meant king-makers.)

If you want to make a difference—and blow Obama out of the water in November 2012—don’t give the American voter an echo—give him a choice.

While the Republican presidential field has many good men an women in its ranks, as do many Congressional and state races across the country, most candidates are corporate-sponsored echoes of big government and crony capitalism.

**Our grassroots movement has come too far to return now to business as usual.**

Last night, I had the rare and wonderful honor of introducing [Phyllis Schlafly](https://www.eagleforum.org/misc/bio.html) at a fundraiser for [Ed Martin](https://edmartinforcongress.com/).  Mrs. Schlafly sits in the conservative pantheon with William F. Buckley, Ronald Reagan, Russell Kirk, and Barry Goldwater.  Her 1964 book, [A Choice Not an Echo: The inside story of how American Presidents are chosen](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0686114868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=hennesssview-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=0686114868)![](https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=hennesssview-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0686114868&camp=217145&creative=399373)
, laid the blueprint for Ronald Reagan’s near-miss in 1976 and victory in 1980.

In 2012, the GOP can give Americans a choice, or it can destroy itself with mere echoes.  At this moment in history, there is no third way.
