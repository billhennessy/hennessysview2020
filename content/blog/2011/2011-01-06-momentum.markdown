[Momentum](https://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/22/detecting-political-momentum-is-harder-than-you-think/) is the _mass_ and _velocity_ of an object. 

 

The object is the American ideology. 

 

The impetus is the conservative grassroots.

 

The velocity is medium.

 

The direction is right.

 

The tactics and tools to [keep the dominos falling to the right](https://biggovernment.com/lkudlow/2011/01/05/supply-side-obama-trust-but-verify/) might change, but the energy and ideals donâ€™t. What brought you out to the tea parties, to the street parties, to the lit drops, and to the door knocking and phone banking parties must carry you forward in 2011 and 2012.

 

The dominos are falling to the right.
