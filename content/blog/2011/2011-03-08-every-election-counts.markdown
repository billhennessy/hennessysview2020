### Next Election: 4 weeks from today. 

 

 

I need a favor. This will only take you a minute (tops), but it’s very important that you do it right now.

 

I will step you through it. 

 

1. Get a pen or pencil and something to write on—preferably a journal or appointment calendar.

 

2. Go to April 5, 2011, or write April 5, 2011, if not using a calendar or dated journal.

 

3. Under April 5, write the following:

 

a. Election Day

 

b. My polling place is: [name it]

 

c. I plan to vote [time of day]

 

d. I will be coming from [place] and will take [major road/highway]

 

e. Immediately before voting, I will be [what you’ll be doing—work, fixing breakfast, taking kids to school, etc.]

 

f. Come hell or high water, though, I will vote on April 5

 

There. You’re done. You’ve developed a personal voting plan to ensure you don’t forget to vote on April 5.

I like Chip Wood because he’s a no-nonsense, grassroots conservative like me. He will make sure property taxes in the county are fair.

If you live in the city, [Jesse Irwin is running a fabulous campaign](https://www.irwinforalderman.com/) for 10th Ward Alderman. I like Jesse because he can represent all of the people of 10th Ward to help stop the city’s population hemorrhage.

 

 

 

Oh, and one more little favor. Get 5 of your friends to make their voting plans today because every election counts toward restoring the American republic.
