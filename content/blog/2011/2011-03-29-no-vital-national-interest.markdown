ABC News is not known as President Obama’s loudest critic. More like his Amen corner. So it’s headline screams even louder:

The rest of [Jake Tapper’s story](https://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2011/03/defense-secretary-libya-did-not-pose-threat-to-us-was-not-vital-national-interest-to-intervene.html) gets more disturbing. 

 

    * The President and the Defense Secretary seem to disagree on national interest** The Secretary of State cannot articulate a consistent US policy** Hillary Clinton seems to believe that the UN is a legal alternative to the US Congress  

More than week into a war that lacks even the thinnest thread of Constitutionality, Barack Obama seems clueless. To the rest of the world, our whole country must look adrift. 

 

Indeed, we are.
