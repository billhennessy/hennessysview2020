Dale Carnegie, of course. 

Published in 1936, Carnagie’s book, _How to Make Friends and Influence People_, remains one of the most important works in interpersonal human relations ever written. 

I wish I’d been humble enough to read this book when I was younger. Might have saved myself a lot of trouble, reputation, and embarrassment. 

Here’s an excerpt: 



> ##### Twelve Ways to Win People to Your Way of Thinking   1. **The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it. **   2. Show respect for the other person's opinions. Never say "You're Wrong."    3. If you're wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.    4. Begin in a friendly way.    5. Start with questions to which the other person will answer yes.    6. Let the other person do a great deal of the talking.    7. Let the other person feel the idea is his or hers.    8. Try honestly to see things from the other person's point of view.    9. Be sympathetic with the other person's ideas and desires.    10. Appeal to the nobler motives.    11. Dramatize your ideas.    12. Throw down a challenge.



Let me apologize to you if I’ve violated one of these simple rules.
