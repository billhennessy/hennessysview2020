We just received this heads up from a friend:



> Just a quick note that Yahoo has apparently changed their "Spam" firewall rules. You're Tea Party updates have been showing up in my spam box for the past couple days. I can't prove there is a conspiracy, but all of my e-mails from conservative organizations are showing up as spam while a lot of other crap is flying right through. Yahoo mail's spam filter is supposed to be an adaptive process. In other words, when I mark each e-mail as not spam, it is supposed to add the sender to my white list. Apparently it is not as smart as I expect. Just giving you an FYI in case this is happening to many others.





All email providers update their spam algorithms regularly. Sometimes email you want gets filtered out.

Thanks to John S. for warning us to check our Yahoo filters.
