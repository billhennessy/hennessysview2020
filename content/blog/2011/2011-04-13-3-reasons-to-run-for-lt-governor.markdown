Patrick Tuohey made some good points about [the office of Lieutenant Governor](https://www.missourirecord.com/blog/index.asp?blog=548).  Based on that, I thought up all the possible reasons someone would run for LooeyG.

1.  Stepping Stone:  Establish state-wide name recognition and give yourself plenty of time to run for that _next_ office, like U.S. Senate or Governor.

2.  Party Reptile:  If the governor is or is likely to be of the opposite party, you get to be the de facto head of your party in the state.

3.  Caretaker: After a long and successful political career, you’re ready for a slower pace. But you want to continue to serve, to be ready in case you’re needed.

Without casting aspersions  on the current or past Lieutenant Governors of Missouri, it’s worth asking LooeyG candidates why they want _that_ office.  And it would be nice to get an honest response.

If a candidate’s reason is reason 1, you can bet that paving the way for the next office is already more important to him than the job he’s got.

P.S.  There might be one more, fun reason to run . . . but _that’s_ a whole different column.
