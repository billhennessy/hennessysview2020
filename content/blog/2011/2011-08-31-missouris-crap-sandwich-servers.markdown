I have a question for State Senator Eric Schmitt: Who says that St. Louis’s 18 million square feet of vacant warehouse space isn’t good enough for Chinese goods?

I heard Senator Schmidt on KMOX a couple of weeks ago. He scoffed at [the Show-Me Institute’s analysis](https://www.showmedaily.org/2011/06/its-still-a-flight-of-fancy.html) of available warehouse space for China Hub saying that to use existing space would be like building F-16s in the Wright Brothers’ hangar. 

He was not asked—and he did not offer—any evidence for his flippant comment. Nor did he take phone calls from the public. 

According to [this report](https://rebootcongress.blogspot.com/2011/08/existing-aerotropolis-warehouse-space.html), the Midwest China Hub Commission flatly contradicts Senator Schmitt’s assertion, saying existing warehouse space is adequate. 

Senator, the comment box is open and awaiting your reply. If you don’t have time to write a response here, I hope you’ll have time to talk to people about it on September 6 when the Special Session opens.
