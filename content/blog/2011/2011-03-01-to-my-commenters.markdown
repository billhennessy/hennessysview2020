I love getting lots of comments, and I encourage you to comment more. (Just say “hello” if that’s all you can think of.) But I want to clear up some misunderstandings about the way comments work. 

 

Over the weekend, a commenter got quite upset at me because her words didn’t appear on my blog 30 seconds after she his Submit. 

 

That’s by design.

 

My comments are moderated. Believe it or not, I attract lunatic-fringe commenters who like to describe the shape and smell of the bullet they intend to use on me. That stuff doesn’t belong on the site, and the only way to keep it off is to moderate comments.

 

Frequent, acceptable commenters I might white-list so that their comments appear immediately. 

 

Those who know me know that I have a more-than-full-time job, a family, and other obligations. Therefore, comments may sit in queue for up to a day. And I reserve the right to block any comment.

 

Thanks for your understanding.
