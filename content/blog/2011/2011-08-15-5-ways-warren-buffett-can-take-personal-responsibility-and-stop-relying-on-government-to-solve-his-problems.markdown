Warren Buffett makes [the erroneous claim](https://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903999904576466541882356616.html) that he pays less in taxes than does his secretary. He claims that the government thus “coddles” the [![alg_warren_buffett](https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/alg_warren_buffett_thumb.jpg)
](https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/alg_warren_buffett.jpg)rich. **He asks the government to increase his taxes, and the taxes of others like him**, as if he is incapable of doing that on his own.

Buffett is half right. He proves that government coddles people by** asking the government to solve his problem of guilt**. 

To help Buffett learn to take care of himself, without government help. here are 3 ways he can assuage his guilt and built his self-esteem by solving the problem himself. 

1. **Pay all you want** to the U.S. Department of the Treasury. 

2. **Go Galt**. Make less money. Give away what you have.

3. **Refuse all corporate welfare** and tax breaks for [all Berkshire-Hathaway companies](https://www.cnbc.com/id/22130601/), saving the treasury billions.

4. **Return the billions in corporate welfare** that your companies have claimed over the past 5 years. 

5. **Pay your poor secretary more**. Increase her salary until she’s in the same, privileged, low tax bracket you enjoy. 

There. Three simple ways that you, Warren Buffett, can solve your little guilt problem **without asking the government to fix your problems for you**. 

BTW, Mr. Buffett, please realize that giving the government 100% of your wealth and all future earnings [will have almost no effect on the national debt](https://stlouisteaparty.com/2011/08/11/does-this-explain-americas-downgrade/). But it will add your name to the dole. 

Now, since we’re all capitalists around here, and because I’d like to get closer to your low tax bracket, where do I send my invoice for $250,000 for this advice?
