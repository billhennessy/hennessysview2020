"It" could refer to anything. Anything at all.   
In this case, though, I'm referring to unemployment. Well, maybe I'm referring to the economy overall.   
[Unemployment rate rises to 9.1%, 54K jobs added Â« Hot Air](https://hotair.com/archives/2011/06/03/unemployment-rate-rises-to-9-1-54k-jobs-added/)  
Obama has increased regulation, seized entire industries (auto, student loans, commercial banking, medicine), and borrowed more money faster than all previous presidents combined.   
Obama is a one-dictator disaster. And an incompetent one at that.   
If you don't have a job, [Obama made it worse](https://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303745304576361852357390230.html?mod=WSJ_Opinion_LEADTop).  
If you have a job, Obama made it worse.  
If you live in America, Obama made it worse.  
Unless you're a communist college professor or union boss, Obama made it worse.
