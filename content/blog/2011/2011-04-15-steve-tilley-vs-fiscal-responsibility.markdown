[Four men risked their political lives](https://biggovernment.com/jwales/2011/04/04/the-four-horsemen-of-the-dem-apocalypse/) to help solve the problem of our lifetimes, but they forgot to massage [Steve Tilley’s](https://www.24thstate.com/2011/03/missouris-establishment-speaker-steve-tilley.html) monstrous ego.

When John McCain (R-AZ) and Roy Blunt (R-MO) agree with Michele Bachmann and Rush Limbaugh, you can bet the issue is beyond debate.

In this case, the issue is the massive U.S. debt and what that debt is about to do to America.

McCain compared the [U.S. situation to Greece and Spain](https://cnsnews.com/node/84016#comment-183699032), saying we should prepare for a “fiscal meltdown.”

Roy Blunt, meanwhile, said raising the debt ceiling without hard measures to cut spending would be “[simply reckless](https://www.pulaskicountydaily.com/news.php?viewStory=2633).”

Has Missouri [House Speaker Steve Tilley](https://rebootcongress.blogspot.com/2011/04/fighting-on-for-tea-party-principles.html) gotten the message?  Apparently not.

Tilley is threatening to knee-cap [the spending deal struck by Missouri Senators](https://hennessysview.com/limited-government/thank-a-senator/) Lembke, Nieves, Schaaf, and Kraus designed to wean Missouri off Washington’s teat.

According to the [News-Leader.com](https://blogs.news-leader.com/mopolitics/2011/04/11/senate-passes-new-unemployment-benefits-bill-tilley-responds/):



> And Tilley said the House won’t put too much weight on what he believes the Senate wants him to do.

“I’m not going to be held hostage by a few people,” he said.



Of course not.  Not unless the hostage takers are billionaires.
