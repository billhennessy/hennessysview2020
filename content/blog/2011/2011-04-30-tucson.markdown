Almost pulled a muscle laughing in the ride from the Tucson airport to our hotel. 

It’s only 5:30 here. Weird. That call that “time difference” for you lefties who read my blog. Has to do with the earth being round and all.

Been a whirlwind day so far. Met Trent and Jennifer Humphries, remarkable Tea Party leaders here in Tucson. Most gracious hosts you can imagine. Funny, dedicated, joyous. 

After checking into hotel, I spoke to [Mike Ferguson of Eagle 93.9 in Columbia](https://theeagle939.com/mike-ferguson/), Missouri. Mike’s a fabulous, liberty-loving host who’s all over the University of Marxism System story. 

Then it was time to strategize with [Gateway Pundit](https://gatewaypundit.rightnetwork.com/) and Chris Loesch. 

Next is Tea Party University with best-selling author Dr. Larry Schweikart. He wrote the book that Glenn Beck called the best history text book ever, _[A Patriot’s History of the United States](https://www.patriotshistoryusa.com/)_. We have a copy at the Hennessy house, and so should you. (Speaking of Hennessy House, LU, Ace.) 

When you’re meeting Tea Partiers for the first time, you’re never really sure what to expect. Trent Humphries is the best kind, and so is Dr. Schweikart—laugh-out-loud funny, appropriately sarcastic, brilliantly engaged with life and reality. 

On the drive to the hotel, Trent shared his stories of battling America’s current brand of demons—people who actually want to destroy this country and everything it stands for. That Trent relates stories of such final consequence with humor and cheer testifies to both his high character and his profound intellect. 

Time to run to the speech. Check back soon.
