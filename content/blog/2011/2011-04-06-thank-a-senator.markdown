State Senators Jim Lembke (@jimlembke), Brian Nieves (@briannieves), Rob Schaaf (@robschaaf), and Will Kraus stood for principle. And the left immediately went berserk.

Let’s begin by telling our Twitter followers and Facebook friends how proud we are are of their brave refusal to take stolen money from Washington.  Tell the world that we support legislators who refuse to let Washington clasp shackles on our liberty.
