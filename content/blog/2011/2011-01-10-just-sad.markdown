How sad is the story of the Tucson tragedy.

Good people died. Good people grieve.

A little girl, born on 9-11, went on her way to her reward. Too soon. So, so too soon.

Experience says that some survivors will become bitter and angry. That’s sad, too.

Some will become depressed.

All will weep.  Especially the little girl’s daddy.  (I can’t bring myself to write their names—that would make it too personal for me.  Too close.)

I hate to ask you to be sad, but sometimes we must be sad.  Political operatives interrupted the grieving process on Saturday and Sunday.  But we have to grieve.  It’s cathartic and necessary. Grief is an appropriate emotion. Intense, short grief is the best—or least bad—kind. Mild, prolonged grief makes us crazy.

And there’s too much of that in the world as it is, as we’ve learned this weekend.


> Eternal rest grant unto them, O Lord.

Let the perpetual light shine upon them.

May their souls—and the souls of all the faithful departed—rest in peace.

Amen.
