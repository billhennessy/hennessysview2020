Even though they became ubiquitous when he was an undergrad,[ Obama just _now_ discovered that ATMs](https://weaselzippers.us/2011/06/14/obama-blames-atm-machines-for-high-unemployment-rates-wait-did-he-say-atm-machines/) reduce foot traffic in banks.  Then again, they probably didn't have the machines in the Kremlin where he spent his semester abroad.

But the [twits are sure having a blast](https://twitter.com/#!/search/atmfacts) with the news (me included).
