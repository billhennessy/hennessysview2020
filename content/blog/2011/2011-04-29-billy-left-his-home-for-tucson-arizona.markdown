I am so proud to be bringing the Spirit of St. Louis to the great people of Tucson, Arizona, this weekend.

Dana Loesch and Jim Hoft are among the speakers at [Tucson’s Tea Party on April 30](https://www.tucsonteaparty.org/). 

The Tea Party is on Saturday, April 30 at 9 am Pacific (11 am Central). And there’s much, much more than just the Tea Party going on. [Check it all out here](https://ttpdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/April-Flyer.pdf). If you have friends in the area, please ask them to come out. Ask them to attend the [Speaker Meet and Greet](https://www.tucsonteaparty.org/p/2010-ballot-propostions.html). 

Following the horrible and sickening slaughter of five innocents and the shooting of more than a dozen others in January, the Tucson Tea Party came under politically motivated attacks by Pima County’s miscreant sheriff. 

Because of harassment and intimidation by Sheriff Dupnik’s Gestapo, [Trent Humphries](https://arizonateaparty.ning.com/profile/TrentHumphries) asked for speakers to come fill out a line-up for their next event. 

Jim, Dana, and I said we’d be honored to defy the [sheriff who refuses to enforce the immigration law](https://patdollard.com/2011/01/flashback-during-illegal-immigration-debate-sheriff-calls-arizona-immigration-law-and-legislatures-passage-of-it-racist/) he’s sworn to uphold. Following Congresswoman Gifford’s shooting, [Dupnik blamed the Tea Party](https://hennessysview.com/crime/a-national-day-of-shame/) and [came under heavy pressure to resign](https://nation.foxnews.com/arizona-shooting-rampage/2011/01/12/calls-mount-sheriff-dupnik-s-resignation). 

If you are able, the great people of Tucson could use [our help with a generous donation](https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_flow&SESSION=dsie4QmMgC5I9UYZxWTZT2uAURIJIZv0BB0mUAa2zenMtKwrBxuXdOrP-S4&dispatch=5885d80a13c0db1f8e263663d3faee8d5863a909c4bb5aeebb52c6e1151bdaa9) for their event.
