Since mass murderer Fidel Castro fired thousands of Cuban government workers due to the economic unviability of Obamanomics, [those set free are enjoying their independence](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/04/world/americas/04cuba.html?_r=1&hp). To the shock of the New York Times:

> “I feel useful; I’m independent,” said Ms. Álvarez, who opened a small cafe in November at her home in this scruffy town 25 miles from the capital, Havana. “When you sit down at the end of the day and look at how much you have made, you feel satisfied.”
