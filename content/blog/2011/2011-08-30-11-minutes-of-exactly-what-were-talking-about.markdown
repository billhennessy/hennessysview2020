[Ed Martin](https://edmartinforcongress.com/) spoke the the Tenth Amendment Center’s Nullification conference in Kansas City. This is a remarkable description of the problem, the dangers, and the solutions of political seduction and abuse of power.

One point that I should have made before being prompted by Ed’s speech. [Trading Missouri sovereignty](https://biggovernment.com/ptuohe/2011/08/21/despite-will-of-voters-missouri-lawmakers-move-to-implement-obamacare-exchanges/) for a few pieces of ObamaCare silver is simple cowardice. Governor Nixon, and any Republican who voted for the healthcare exchange, should be retired—on their own or in a primary.

Who’s going to Jefferson City for the Special Session on September 6? I think we need some people there to help the (upper case) Republicans act like (lower case) republicans.
