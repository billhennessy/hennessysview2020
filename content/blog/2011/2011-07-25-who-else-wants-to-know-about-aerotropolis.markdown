With thanks to [Show-Me Institute](https://showmeinstitute.org/publications/case-study/corporate-welfare/578-aerotropolis-a-raw-deal-for-missouri.html) for their wonderful research.

Points to remember:




** The China Hub is not dependent on Aerotropolis
** The [author of the plan thinks it will fail](https://www.showmedaily.org/2011/07/aerotropolis-author-doesnt-think-saint-louis-proposal-will-work.html)
** St. Louis has 18 million square feet of empty warehouse space right now
** Aerotropolis would [hurt many companies](https://www.showmedaily.org/2011/06/air-cargo-expet-hammers.html) who have vacant warehouse space
** Aerotropolis would transfer $360 million tax dollars to just two entities: a private developer and the City of St. Louis
** No one knows if or [how many jobs Aerotropolis might create](https://www.showmedaily.org/2011/06/eco-devo-madlibs-so-are-5000.html).  Even the RCGA has released 3 separate guesses
** Most Missouri Legislators are clueless about the bill—but your State Rep voted for it, anyway.
