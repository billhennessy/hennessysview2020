Last week, America’s sleaziest leftists—Bill Maher, Chris Matthews, Keith Olbermann, E. J. Dionne, Paul Krugman, others – have [executed a prepared [![BillMaherAngry](https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/BillMaherAngry_thumb.jpg)
](https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/BillMaherAngry.jpg)propaganda war](https://hennessysview.com/crime/a-national-day-of-shame/) against anyone who disagrees with them. Their theorem is: vitriolic rhetoric inspires conservatives to act out in violence.

 

Unfortunately for [the loony left](https://gatewaypundit.rightnetwork.com/2011/01/figures-charles-johnsons-hero-arrested-for-threatening-to-kill-tea-party-leader-on-national-tv/), there was no evidence to support their theorem. The evidence they falsely pointed to—Jarod Lee Loughner’s deranged murder rampage in Tucson—was determined to be a lie only hours after the event.

 

Undaunted, Maher, Krugman, Donne, Matthews, and crew continued to lie, lie, lie, lie. They refused to let go of their story, false though it was.

 

On Saturday, the leftist “rhetoric = violence” cult got something close to vindication. Perhaps responding to the hateful, [violent rhetoric from Krugman, Matthews, Maher, Dionne, and Olbermann](https://hotair.com/archives/2011/01/15/quotes-of-the-day-570/), Tucson shooting victim and [hard-left activist, J. Eric Fuller, was arrested](https://biggovernment.com/publius/2011/01/16/activist-who-made-death-threat-to-tea-party-leader-committed-for-a-psychiatric-evaluation/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+BigGovernment+(Big+Government)) for communicating a direct threat against a tea party leader in Tucson. ([More at Michelle Malkin](https://michellemalkin.com/2011/01/15/tucson-shooting-victim-charged-for-death-threat-to-tea-party-leader/).)

 

Fuller issued the threat after photographing tea party leader Trent Humphries. (Was the photo’s purpose to help the hit man ID the target?)

 

If Krugman, Matthews, Olbermann, Maher, et al, were correct in their assessment of blame to conservatives, then Krugman, Matthews, Olbermann, Maher, et al, are at least as guilty of conveying a threat as Fuller.

 

But if Krugman, Matthews, Olbermann, Maher, et al, were wrong about rightwing rhetoric, than I am wrong about their culpability in Eric Fuller’s psycho moment.

 

I think there are only two people responsible for their criminal actions: Loughner and Fuller. But I think Krugman, Matthews, Olbermann, Maher, Dionne, et al, are guilty of exploiting tragedy and emotions to destroy their political opponents.
