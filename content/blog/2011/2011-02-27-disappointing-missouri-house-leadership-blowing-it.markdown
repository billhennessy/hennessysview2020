I continue hearing reliable reports that the GOP Leadership in the Missouri House keeps its boot on the throat of Tea Party freshmen. 

 

What a shame.

 

The party that was flat on its back from 2006 to 2009 rose back to power because of the tea party. But, it seems, the Missouri branch of the party didn’t get the message. And its Speaker in the Missouri House has become tighter with left-fringe Democrats that with conservatives of his own party. 

 

Maybe tea party legislators need a Tea Party Caucus in Jefferson City. 

 

If the Missouri House Republican leaders don’t get the message soon, their big majority will disappear in the blink of an eye, and statewide Republican candidates will pay the price. 

 

So will our country.
