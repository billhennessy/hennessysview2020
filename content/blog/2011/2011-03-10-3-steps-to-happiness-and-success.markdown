Some of the biggest potholes on the road to happiness come from bad advice from self-help “experts.”

 

But here are three scientifically proven steps to being happier. And since happiness causes success in other areas, not the other way around, these could be the most important tasks you perform. 

 

 

**Give Thanks**

 

People who write down three things they’re grateful for and the reason those things happened show a 50 percent drop in medical claims over six months compared to a control group who journaled about nothing in particular (Emmons & McCullough).

 

So get a notebook and write down three things you’re thankful for one day a week. If you’re a digital type, then go to [www.thankfulfor.com](https://www.thankfulfor.com). There you can post (private or public) gratitudes. They even have an iPhone app to make giving thanks all the easier. 

 

 

**Record Your Acts of Kindness**

 

On another day of the week, write down two things you did for others out of kindness. Studies show that reflecting on your own good deeds will lower blood pressure and put you in a better mood. Plus, you’ll start to look for opportunities to do little acts of kindness, even as simple as smiling at a stranger.

 

 

****Walk****

 

A casual stroll of just 10 or 15 minutes can set you in a much better mood. Do this three days a week.

 

There. Three free, simple acts to make you happier, healthier, and more successful.
