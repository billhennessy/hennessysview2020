Citizen involvement is “snowballing” across the State of Missouri as the Center for Self Governance adds more classes to its schedule.  The ultimate goal is to have a CSG team in every county in the state in order to influence your elected officials and policy.   If you feel frustrated because you feel powerless to “effect change”…the CSG training will prepare you to start...or become part of...a CSG “seal team” in your area. 





 





Below you will find an updated calendar of locations and times for upcoming Center for Self Governance classes throughout the State in August.   





 





MOPP proudly endorses the CSG training as it complements the MOPP goals of encouraging citizen involvement at the most local levels of government and community where we, as citizens, can be most easily engaged and ultimately most effective.  In fact, MOPP has many members who are already participating in this program that equips citizens to learn how to influence the legislative process by becoming effective citizen lobbyists.





 





There are 5 levels of training to complete the training...an explanation of each level can be found at this link:  **[https://www.tncsg.org/overview-of-classes/](https://www.tncsg.org/overview-of-classes/)**
