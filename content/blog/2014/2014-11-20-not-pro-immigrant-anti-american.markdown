Let's be honest with ourselves: President Obama's unilateral, dictatorial action on immigration is not to benefit illegals. It's to punish American voters for rejecting him.

This is personal.

In two years, the next American president will let this and many other Obama executive orders expire. Executive orders are not law. They expire with the term of the president who signed them. No future president is bound to renew them. And the next president won't.

So life for the illegals will get worse. Instead of wrongfully believe they've been denied something, they'll correctly feel they've lost something. They'll feel vulnerable and abandoned. All because Obama needed to "get even" with the American people.

Increasingly, Obama's actions are not just wrong; they're evil.
