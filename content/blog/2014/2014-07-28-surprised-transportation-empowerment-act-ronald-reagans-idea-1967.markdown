Last week I blogged that [Ronald Reagan would love the Transportation Empowerment Act (TEA)](https://hennessysview.com/2014/07/13/ronald-reagan-wants-transportation-empowerment-act/). I included audio of Reagan talking to Bill Buckley on Firing Line about the burden on states from onerous federal taxes and grants.

Forgive me, but that was sort of a tease. Here's the meat: Reagan wrote a proposal for the Republican Governors' Conference of 1967 to allow states to keep  about 2 percent of all federal taxes raised in the state. Ninety-eight percent would still go to Washington for defense and studies of monkey sex lives and whatever they do with money up there, but the states would retain two percent.

Here's the Gipper:

Now, please [call Ann Wagner's Ballwin office](https://wagner.house.gov/contact/offices) and ask her to co-sponsor TEA. It'll help her Heritage Action Score.

The Transportation Empowerment Act is[ the right way to deal with Missouri's overwhelming bike path problems](https://hennessysview.com/2014/07/26/francis-slay-wont-tell-missouri-roads/) and provides a [smart alternative to the biggest tax increase in Missouri's history](https://hennessysview.com/2014/07/15/francis-slay-destroys-transportation-sales-tax-trying-support/).
