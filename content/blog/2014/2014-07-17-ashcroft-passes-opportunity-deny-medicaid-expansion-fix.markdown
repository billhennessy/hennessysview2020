Last week, I wrote about the [Missouri Republican Establishment's plan to win a windfall for lobbyist Kit Bond](https://hennessysview.com/2014/07/04/chamber-royale/) via Senate candidate Jay Ashcroft. Not that the Establishment cares about Bond, but they want Medicaid expansion passed before they beg for money for 2016 from the Missouri Hospital Association and Chamber of Commerce.

Well, the [St. Louis Post Dispatch asked Ashcroft about the deal](https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/political-fix/article_9d361ae2-86a6-58ab-8638-cd48a4fb4f56.html#.U8P7Ka-xOH4.twitter), and he couldn't quite bring himself to deny that he would pass Medicaid expansion if elected.

So a Medicaid deal is still in play, Jay?





For the record, none of the [Missouri US Congress Republicans who attended a fundraiser for Ashcroft](https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/political-fix/article_9d361ae2-86a6-58ab-8638-cd48a4fb4f56.html#.U8P7Ka-xOH4.twitter) have denied Kit Bond's influence in the event. Or on Ashcroft's last-minute decision to run.





I understand it will be difficult to fill John Lamping's shoes, but evading questions about backroom deals on Obamacare is a step in the wrong direction for Ashcroft.
