### Heritage Action/St. Louis Tea Party Social: June 19



On Thursday, June 19 at 6:30pm, we will gather informally at [Scarecrow in Chesterfield](https://www.scarecrowstl.com/), 1095 Chesterfield Parkway.  All are welcome.  Appetizers will be provided.  Come down and enjoy the company of fellow grassroots activists.

If you have friends who think Tea Partiers are "too extreme" or "racist" or whatever, bring them along. There won't be a bunch of political speeches to scare them away. Just conversation about restoring their power so they can keep the republic.  [RSVP on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/466890610123117/)
