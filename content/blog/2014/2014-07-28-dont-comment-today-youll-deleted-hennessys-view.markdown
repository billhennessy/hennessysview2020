If you registered as a user but never commented AND you want to continue getting an email notification when new blogs are posted, all you have to do is **COMMENT on this blog**. Say anything, like "don't delete me, bro."

Here's why: my blog has about 8,000 registered users. That sounds great, I know, but it's not. **Most of these registered users are zombies**. They were created by a spam bot so the bot could post spam comments.

These zombie users slow down the sight for everyone, and they present a security risk. Plus, they prevent me from implementing a cool new newsletter feature I'll tell you more about in the next couple of weeks.

**I am going to delete every user who has never commented on this blog on Tuesday, July 29 at 6:00 pm. **

So why aren't there a bunch of spammy comments with all these zombies hanging around? Good question. I use Akismet spam blocker to block spam comments. But I require commenters to be registered users. While Akismet stops the comments, it doesn't stop the registration spammers.

After I clean up the zombies, I'm going to install software to block new zombie users, but that won't affect you.

Once again, **if you want to remain on my email list and able to comment, you must comment by 6:00 pm CDT on Tuesday, July 28, 2014.**

If you get deleted, just re-register. I hope you do.

And if you haven't registered, I recommend making a note on your calendar to do so AFTER Tuesday.

Thanks,
Bill
