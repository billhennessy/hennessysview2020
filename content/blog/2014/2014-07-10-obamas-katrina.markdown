**Visuals**: Some of the thousands of children suffering in a humanitarian disaster at the US border on the top of the split screen. On the bottom, President Obama drinking beer and shooting pool with locals 246 miles away.

[**Audio**](https://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2014/07/09/Obama-Happy-to-Consider-Deploying-National-Guard-to-Border): President on deploying National Guard to alleviate humanitarian crisis: "I'd be happy to consider it," but it would be "a temporary solution."

**Face it**: the press was going to blame George Bush for Katrina no matter what. That's what the press does. I understand that.

But the Bush administration's handling of the post-Katrina crisis was a visual disaster on par with the humanitarian disaster.

Don't worry, though. This isn't a critique of post-Katrina actions. It's an observation of Obama's handling of the what's going on with the flood of illegals.



### The Border Crisis is Obama's Katrina.



First, Obama's actions led led to the crisis. As we used to say during the Reagan Administration, ideas have consequences. As [Senator Ted Cruz told Fox News](https://www.breitbart.com/Breitbart-Texas/2014/06/12/Cruz-on-Fox-Border-Crisis-for-Kids-a-Result-of-Obama-Message):



> It's important to understand what causes this… President Obama unilaterally and illegally granted amnesty to some 800,000 people who were here illegally who came as children.



I'll say it again: no reasonable person will deny that the humanitarian disaster along the US Southern border is a disaster the President asked for.

And the crisis threatens to swamp the scale of Katrina.



### Cautious Prediction



Obama's smug arrogance and complete lack of urgency or compassion for the children dumped on America's door step [![Obama Smug](https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Obama-Smug-300x200.jpg)
](https://hennessysview.com/2014/07/09/obamas-katrina/obama-smug/#main)borders on pathological. The crisis reveals Obama as a psychopath. If he really doesn't care, he's an indifferent psychopath. If the border disaster is a Cloward-Pivens tactic, he's a power-hungry psychopath. Obama has no path out that doesn't lead through the psychopathic jungle.

A glance at the mainstream media tells me that Obama's amen chorus is ready to abandon their former hero. But I could be wrong, and it wouldn't be the first time.

No matter what, Obama's psychopathy is undeniable.
