It's funny, really, that America celebrates the day we signed up to fight a brutal war for independence, not the day that war was won.

But I want to write about football.

I've always hated the Dallas Cowboys.

Cut me a little slack, though. I was a Big Red fan from childhood, and a season ticket holder from 1978 to 1983. ("Big Red" refers to the St. Louis Football Cardinals for those of you under 40.) My heroes were Conrad Dobler, Dan Dierdorf, Jim Hart, Tim Van Gelder, Terry Metcalf, Jim Otis, Council Roudolf, Roger Wherle, Larry Stallings, Larry Wilson, J.V. Cain, Roger Finney, Tom Banks, Bob Young, Mel Grey, Roy Green, Pat Tilley, Ottis Anderson, Theotis Brown, Jim Bakken, Johnny "Dr. Doom" Barefield . . . shall I go on?

The St. Louis Cardinals played in the NFC East in the 1970s and 1980s, along with the Dallas Cowboys, the Washington Redskins, the Philadelphia Eagles, and the New York Giants. That was a killer division back then, and the Cowboys were killerest of all.

My anti-Cowboy aquifer runs so deep and cold that I once said, "If the Cowboys were playing al Qaeda I don't know who I'd root for."

<del>As I matured</del> . . . Strike that. I haven't matured.

After the Cardinals moved onto Phoenix, my passions against the Cowboys subsided a bit. When Jerry Jones crassly fired the legendary coach Tom Landry, I immediately became a Tom Landry fan. Landry might have been the wisest and most gentlemanly NFL head coach of all time.

Tom Landry took winning as seriously as the next guy, but football and winning were not the most important things to Landry. In 1979, he berated and fired linebacker Thomas "Hollywood" Henderson because Henderson was goofing with a camera while his team was getting massacred on the football field.

Landry did more than humiliate Henderson, though. [He might have saved Henderson's life](https://www.ministryserver.com/rwsr/ltei4.htm):



> Just this morning, 9/11/94, I heard Hollywood Henderson -- X-Cowboy of considerable fame -- from Austin on the Fox Network. He said that in the days when he was playing for the Cowboys and "at the same time doing drugs," and "ruining his life," he "resented Tom Landry." He resented Tom Landry’s Christianity, and the fact that he had a happy family life.

Now, in 1994, after spending some time in prison, and after 11 years of being free of his drug addiction, Hollywood Henderson says that he has a little different slant on life. He said that he once was hopeless, but is now hopeful. **He says that today, Tom Landry is his "role model"**!



The Hollywood Henderson story typifies Tom Landry's simple definition of leadership:



> Leadership is getting someone to do what they don't want to do, to achieve what they want to achieve.

—Tom Landry, Hall of Fame Coach of the Dallas Cowboys



Few people actually _want_ to lift weights, eat healthy diets, and build stamina. But we all want to avoid disease, live long lives, and look good in a swimming suit. We need someone to help us do what we don't want to do so we can achieve what we want to achieve. That someone is a leader.

America didn't want to go through another deep recession in the early 1980s, but Ronald Reagan and Paul Volcker knew we wanted America to flourish again, so they orchestrated an interest rate driven recession that finally choked out inflation—from 13.5% in 1981 to 3.2% in 1983.

And the Revolutionary Army didn't want to winter in Valley Forge, but Washington helped them fight through to ultimate victory and independence.

I know some people don't like my criticizing Republicans who put their own personal agenda or the party's power before American greatness and freedom. I sure don't like it. Many are even more reluctant to get leverage on the GOP with bold actions. People worry that getting political leverage on Republicans could help [Democrats and their anti-freedom agenda](https://hennessysview.com/2014/07/05/awesome-video-us-army-sergeant-tells-iraqi-police-way/).

But we need more than a victorious Republican Party. We really don't care about the name of the party that delivers us from tyranny, crony capitalism, and fascism. We want a strong, prosperous, and free America. In the words of the preamble to the Constitution, we want to secure the blessings of liberty for ourselves and posterity.

[When I encourage liberty lovers to get some leverage against miscreant Republicans](https://hennessysview.com/2014/06/24/new-political-dichotomy/), I do it only because I want us to achieve what we all want to achieve. And I recognize that achieving our big goals often requires doing things we don't want to do.

Here's what Hollywood Henderson said about Tom Landry:






> I have a vision of him standing on that tower. He was maybe three stories above the team in training camp. That's sort of where I remember him the five years I was in the Cowboys' training camp--30 feet in the air overseeing us. Untouchable. We couldn't throw a rock and hit him. I tell you, you sort of didn't like him. You were afraid of him. You resented him. **But when the dust settled, you wanted to be like him**. **When you had a family, took care of a company, managed people, you idolized him**.








I think it's a uniquely American quality that we commemorate the dates we signed up to do the hard work, not the dates we accomplished the mission. July 4th, 1776. December 7, 1941. September 11, 2001. We are a people of rash vows. Or, at least, we wish we were.

G. K. Chesterton wrote an essay "In Defence of Rash Vows." In it, he summarized the importance of this American tendency to celebrate the making of the vow:



> The man who makes a vow makes an appointment with himself at some distant time or place. The danger of it is that himself should not keep the appointment. And in modern times this terror of one’s self, of the weakness and mutability of one’s self, has perilously increased, and is the real basis of the objection to vows of any kind. 



Tom Landry's leadership gives us the confidence to make appointments with ourselves in the future so long as we have leaders who will drive us to do what we don't want to do in order that might keep our appointment.

I never wanted to like Tom Landry. But I want to achieve the kind of things he achieved--helping people reach their goals even those goals required them doing things they don't want to do.

Now, I'm going to work out.
