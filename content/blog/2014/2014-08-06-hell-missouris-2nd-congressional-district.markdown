No time for deep analysis tonight, but there's a small political earthquake in St. Louis County.

With over 90% of the precincts counted in the Missouri primary, incumbent Congresswoman Ann Wagner has only 500 more votes than her November challenger, Democrat Arthur Lieber.

I get that this is a primary and that the St. Louis County Executive race drew a lot of attention. But Wagner won her seat in 2012 by 20 points. And polls show that [Democrat voter enthusiasm is down 23 percent](https://www.politico.com/story/2014/05/2014-midterms-voter-enthusiasm-poll-106571.html) from 2012.

Assuming the Dooley-Stenger race overcame half that Dem enthusiasm deficit, Wagner should have received about 15,000 more votes than Lieber.

Adding to my curiosity about this race is a story today that [voter approval of their own member of Congress is at an all time low](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/08/05/a-majority-of-people-dont-like-their-own-congressman-for-the-first-time-ever/) with 51 percent disapproving of the job their own Congressperson is doing.

If the MO-2 results hold up, this November could be a shocker for incumbents, which means the GOP's House majority could be in jeopardy.

Buckle up.
