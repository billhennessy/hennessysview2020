Eileen Tyrrell is the only candidate who represents ALL the stakeholders in Rockwood School District.

While other candidates focus onÂ _more money for the system_, Eileen focuses on using Rockwood's (embarrassingly) ample resources better.

Here's what you need to ask youself:




  1. Do you plan to fulfill your duty to vote on April 8?
  2. What time of day do you plan to vote?
  3. Where will be and what will you be doing immediately before you go to vote?




See you at the polls on April 8 to vote for Eileen Tyrrell.
