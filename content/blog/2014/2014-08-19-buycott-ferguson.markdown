**DON'T STOP SHOPPING!**

The Buycott is underway. Great turnout on Thursday. Fantastic support from the media. Even Senator Claire McCaskill joined the buycott. [Read all about it here.](https://hennessysview.com/2014/08/21/why-st-louis-tea-party-went-to-ferguson-to-shop/)

In the meantime, keep shopping Ferguson/Dellwood if you get the chance. And make an appointment on your calendar to shop Ferguson/Dellwood on Labor Day Weekend. Have out-of-town guests? Take them on a tour and have a meal in one of the great restaurants in the area.

Wherever you live in Greater St. Louis, the world judges your home town by what it hears. Let the world hear that Ferguson came back stronger than it went into the terrible riots of the last two weeks.

*****Original Post Follows*****

Thursday, August 21, 5:00 to 6:00 pm.

Dozens of Ferguson businesses have suffered damage. Not only do those businesses need healing, their customers need their services.



### We can help. BUYcott Ferguson.



Just as [we helped Whole Foods by BUYcotting September 1, 2009](https://hennessysview.com/2013/12/04/favorite-st-louis-tea-party-wasnt-tea-party/), we can help small businesses in Ferguson by BUYcotting Thursday, August 21, 5 to 6:30 pm.

Here's what you need to do.




*1. Go to W. Florissant on Thursday between 5 and 6:30.
*2. Bring a shopping list: groceries, beer, smokes, something for the kids, whatever
*3. Look for businesses with boarded up windows and spray painted OPEN signs
*4. Shop




### Why You Should Do This



Because there's not much else you and I can do right now. Yeah, protests feel good in the moment, but they don't really change things.

On the other hand, every store you shop will be one step closer to recovery. Every store that recovers makes life easier for residents. Every life made easier gets you one step closer to heaven. And that's the only reason we're here.

Please watch HennessysView.com in the coming days for more details. Pray for this mission. It'll work.

I'd like to see 20 people join this demonstration of faith, healing, and free markets. Everything over that is gravy.

**UPDATE: DETAILS**

First, thanks for the great response. I'm excited.

Next, here's the details for Thursday:




*1. The situation is fluid, and we don't want to interfere with police OR with peaceful demonstrators. So WATCH THIS BLOG AND YOUR EMAIL on Thursday in case things change.
*2. Some stores might be low on inventory. If it looks that way, ask. We don't want to leave local residents without stuff that we can buy somewhere else. With the traffic restrictions, Ferguson residents have a hard time getting out to distant shops.
*3. NO SIGNS OR SPEECHES. We're not their proselytize or politic. We're their to lead recovery, healing, faith, and free markets.
*4. MUSTER on the Sam's Club lot, southeast corner, around 5:00 pm. If you'd like to start earlier, please don't wait. Here's a link to the map: [Sam's Club, 10735 W Florissant Ave Ferguson, MO 63136](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sam's+Club/@38.7651138,-90.2786401,17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xee35e1a60eda7589)


5. OBEY POLICE and respect peaceful demonstrators. We have been in their shoes many times together in the past.

6. SMILE and be friendly. It's been a hard week and a half in Ferguson, and a friendly smile will go a long way. 

7.  Listen to Jamie in the Morning at 6:10 am Wednesday for the latest updates.

8.  We'll designate a post BUYcott meeting spot tomorrow if you'd like to get together for a little After Party. I'll update this post.

9.  Thank you, again. You are wonderful people.

Finally, I read a story not long ago about a man who jumped from the Golden Gate Bridge. He passed about 40 people as he walked to a spot on the bridge. He looked around for a few minutes as more people rushed passed. Then he jumped.

When police investigated his apartment, they found a note. Among other thoughts, the jumper wrote: "If one person smiles at me, I won't do it."

You never know how your friendly smile will change a life. Or save one. 

God bless you.
