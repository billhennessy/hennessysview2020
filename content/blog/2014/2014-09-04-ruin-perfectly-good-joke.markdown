If you talk long enough, you can butcher the best joke in the world--even the one from Monty Python that the Allies used to win WWII.

Tuesday night at a Tea Party meeting, I managed to destroy a joke of my own, poor making, and insult a friend at the same time. That takes talent. Or . . . something.

So, first, let me apologize to [Adam Sharp, the best indy video journalist alive](https://sharpelbowsstl.blogspot.com/), since he was the victim of my horrible comedic delivery. Also, I apologize to the 30 people I confused with the joke.

Now, for how to ruin a joke: talk.

Here's the joke I intended: Adam Sharp committed the ultimate sin of journalism ethics--he asked a Democrat Congressman about the Constitution.

Or

Thanks to Adam Sharp, we now know it's unethical for a journalist to ask a Democrat about the Constitution.

Okay. Not fall on the floor, but you get it, right?

But that's not the joke I told. Instead, I rambled on for a minute in set-up. I built it up for an ending that no punchline could deliver. And then I fumbled the punchline.

In 2010, [Adam Sharp asked Phil Hare how he could square Obamacare with the US Constitution.](https://sharpelbowsstl.blogspot.com/2010/04/ill-congressman-phil-hare-doesnt-care.html) Rep. Hare answered,  "I don't worry about the Constitution."

WHAMO!  Hare's done as a member of Congress. The video went viral. It was a turning point (one of many) in the 2010 election.

But the drive-by media wanted to claim Sharp's question was inappropriate, that he edited out key parts, etc. The usual nonsense. As you saw, Adam provided more context than was probably necessary.

I knew the audience was familiar with story, so I tried a little sarcastic humor. I still think it _would_ have been funny if someone more capable had delivered it.

Sorry, Adam. I think you rock. And my delivery sucks.

H/T to [Van Harvey](https://blogodidact.blogspot.com/) for calling me out on this.

Don't believe my joke <del>bombed</del> sucked? See for yourself:

Face palm. Cringe. Gag. Vomit.
