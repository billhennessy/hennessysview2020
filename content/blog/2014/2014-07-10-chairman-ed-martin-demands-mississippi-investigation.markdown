I'm on the road this week, but I'm thrilled to get this email from Missouri GOP Chairman Ed Martin:

Republicans were asking about re Mississippi especially about the racially divisive ads run in support of Senator Cochran.

Many of you gave me good advice, some were silent, and I got lots of input from Mississippi too.  My purpose in this is for us - we the RNC - to lead and help find out exactly what happened and move past it.  I consider this type of leadership central to our role as party leaders.

> Some of my discussions were not easy with others being brought in via forwarded emails and some were contentious (with one exchange bordering on threatening) as folks want to move on.  I mean this to be an RNC issue - that we sort out.  But we cannot shy from the truth.

At this point, I am asking Reince to lead us - to appoint a committee of we RNC members to get to the bottom of the facts regarding the racially divisive ads and to report back to us for the August meeting.  I have purposely left the membership of this committee up to Reince so that he can move quickly.

I do not mean for this to be hostile but I do mean this to be about truth-telling.  I hope you will consider supporting my request.

You and I both know that Ed Martin is a stand-up guy. You may not know the pressure the GOP establishment puts on Ed. They didn't want him as chairman because of actions like this.









Simply put, Ed Martin puts America before the Republican Party, and the Republican Party hates it.









Ed needs our support. The establishment will come at him with knives.









I'm with Ed.
