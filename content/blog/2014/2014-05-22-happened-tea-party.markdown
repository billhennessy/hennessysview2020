I'll give Business Insider some credit. After Tea Party-backed candidates came up empty across the board in Tuesday's Republican primaries, the website that has spent years maligning our rule-of-law movement could have taken the low road.

Instead, blogger Brett Logiurato wrote a fair assessment of what's happened to the GOP since February 27, 2009.



> The much-talked about Republican "civil war" is over, at least for the people who thought it even existed in the first place. Both the Tea Party grassroots and the GOP establishment have taken lessons from the clashes over the past three election cycles. Republicans have learned to adopt more Tea Party talking points, and conservative grassroots voters have shown they are willing to back establishment candidates who have adopted their views.

Logiurato describes the changes in Mitch McConnell's behavior to illustrate the fusion of the two factions:



> In 2008, as he had been for much of his career, McConnell was a proud [promoter of congressional earmarks](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/23/us/politics/23mcconnell.html?pagewanted=all) and the money he was able to bring back to Kentucky. He ran an ad during that race boasting about the more than $1 billion he brought back to the state.
. . .
By 2010, as Tea Party earned a series of election victories and earmarks became a symbol of waste in Washington, McConnell helped end them. He won't campaign on "bringing home the bacon" this year, and he stands firmly against an effort to bring back earmarks.



"McConnell’s evolving message shows how the real Tea Party can co-opt and win over the GOP establishment when it sticks to its principles," wrote John Hart, Sen. Tom Coburn's former communications director, [on Real Clear Politics](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2014/05/21/what_the_media_miss_about_the_tea_party_movement_122699.html).



Getting Mitch McConnell to talk right is one thing; getting him to vote right is another. 

If the GOP lets the[ Export-Import Bank of Boeing](https://hennessysview.com/2014/04/19/jonah-goldberg-perfectly-defines-gop-establishment/) die a graceful death this year, I'll be impressed. If McConnell and the House leadership begin turning their backs on corporate lobbyists who use government to thwart innovation and kill competition, then the Tea Party can claim a big victory. But I'm not holding my breath.

Let's face it: none of us knew what the hell we were doing when 50 little groups held simultaneous protests in February 2009. We had no plan for what to do after that first event, awkwardly titled The Nationwide Chicago Tea Party Protest. After that first wave, some of us got together on a call, and Mike Leahy offered a plan. He said "this is a 10-round, heavyweight fight that will end with knockout on Election Day 2010."

Yeah, we did that. But we never really had a plan for how we would do it. We knew how to hold a damn fantastic rally, though, so we held a bunch of them. We knew how to change the narrative with video, and we did that. We knew how get under Barack Obama's skin, and we did that.

But victory is often the cruelest defeat. Following the 2010 election, we thought big. Really damn big. We were certain we'd be calling the shots in 2012. After all, the GOP was on life support after the 2008 elections. George Will scolded conservatives for uttering the word "socialism." The New York Times predicted a permanent Democrat majority in almost every state.

The only center-right heartbeat leading up to the 2010 election was in the Tea Party. At that first Tea Party, Hall of Famer Jackie Smith said he'd never been to a political rally before. He asked the crowd of over 1,000 people to raise their hands if this was their first time. Almost every hand went up.

These people were not on Republican walk lists. There not consistent voters. They were ordinary people answering a call. They were sick of a government that took their blue collar wages to spare Wall Street millionaires and 8-figure CEOs the embarrassment of admitting "we fucked up the world."

Hell yes, we lost our focus after 2010. At least I did. I started dreaming about rebuilding the Reagan coalition. I was thrilled to stand alongside people who'd been in the trenches for decades. I didn't ask if their one, true passion was letting people live their own lives. I assumed it. That was a mistake.

In hindsight, I should have been far more humble. I should have paid attention to my own warnings about assuming the future will be a linear progression of the recent past. But I ignored myself. I looked at the Tea Party's (and my own) recent past and projected out into the future. I like what I saw. I saw myself on TV, and I thought I looked damn good. (I'm always too eager to get my stupid mug on TV. I watched way too much Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson starting way too young, but that's another story.)

Three dangerous developments emerged in 2011 that I should have stopped. I didn't. Either I didn't want the confrontation, or didn't realize the danger, or I was afraid that challenging a bad idea might drive away a faction--a faction I thought we needed.

Those three developments:




*1. Fascination with massive conspiracies.
*2. Hedonistic pleasure from angry protests.
*3. Intellectual isolationism around 18th century political philosophy.


Maybe someday I'll explain those three developments in more detail. For now, I just want you to know that I saw them--and did nothing.

The right direction is the one my friend[ Brian Bollmann](https://rockinconservative.com/) took. Brian hooked up with the Center for Self-Governance. He didn't just scream and yell at politicians. He learned how to talk to politicians. And now, they call him and ask how they should vote.

Brian got some power back.

When a handful of people get some power back, you don't need 10,000 people yelling in a park. You don't. Sure, we needed 10,000 angry people in Kiener Plaza in 2009. It was a recruitment drive. We had to tell the thousands like us, "you're not alone. It's safe to come out now."

When a handful of Brian Bollmanns get some power back, you don't need to shout about Agenda 21. Instead, you quietly inform poor people in public housing that Smart Meters will raise their electric bills to $120 a month from $25. That's what Self-Governance students in Memphis did, and Memphis Power and Light removed the Smart Meters.

When a handful of Brian Bollmanns get some power back, you don't even think about cloistering yourself in an ideologically safe vacuum and pleasure yourself with the vibrating echo. You talk to people who never heard of Thomas Paine about how they're going to pay off their student loans.

I know it pisses off some good people every time I say I like Ann Wagner. I do. I enjoy talking to her, and I admire the things she's accomplished. I can't imagine myself yelling at her, and I know it would hurt our cause if I did. I'd like her to fight against extending the [Export-Import Bank](https://hennessysview.com/2014/05/19/politics-linked-stock-market/) because the [Export-Import Bank represents a redistribution of wealth ](https://heritageaction.com/2014/05/export-import-bank-twitter-account-smallbiz-153-boeing-1/)and puts the government in the position of protecting large corporations from the free market. In short, the Ex-Im Bank is a clearinghouse of crony capitalism.

I know Ann and many of her Republican colleagues in Congress believe in the free market. But the free market doesn't have a lobby. Except us. Except me.

So what happened to the Tea Party? I hope it got a lot friendlier and a lot more effective. Maybe now we can stop trying to topple big name "Republicrats" and start using our power of persuasion and influence to get Republicans to vote the way they talk.
