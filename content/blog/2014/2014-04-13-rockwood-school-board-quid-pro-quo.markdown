From the "see, I told ya so" file . . .

Rockwood NEA President Suzanne Dotta worked hard to influence the recent school board election. The candidates Ms. Dotta pushed won.

[The new board hired Ms. Dotta as Director of Professional Learning within 72 hours of the election](https://www.rockwood.k12.mo.us/news/Pages/041114Rockwood-Hires-New-Administrators-.aspx).

I expect Ms. Dotta to teach Rockwood's professionals how to game the system for personal gain at taxpayer expense.

If you'd like to question this apparent _quid pro quo_, the next Rockwood Board meeting is April 24.  Meetings are held at Crestview Middle School, located at 16025 Clayton Road in Ellisville.  Meetings begin at 7:00 p.m.
