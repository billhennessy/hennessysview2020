I told my nephew Scott that I was worried about the parallels between this year's Stanley Cup Playoffs Round 1 and last year's bitter collapse to the LA Kings.

That conversation happened last Sunday at an Easter party. The Blues were up 2-0 at the time, preparing for Game 3 in Chicago. My trepidation stemmed from the pattern emerging:




** Blues playing defending Stanley Cup Champions in Round 1
** Steen wins Game 1 on overtime goal
** Jackman scores game winner in Game 2


The parallels didn't stop there. Here's the freaky comparison of Blues 2013 and 2014 playoffs:



2013 Round 1 Blues vs. Kings (defending Stanley Cup champions)
Game 1: Alex Steen scored game-winning goal in OT.
Game 2: Barret Jackman scored game-winning goal.
Game 3: Blues outshot Kings by nine, got shut out.
Game 4: Blues blew 3-2 lead late in third period, lost 4-3.
Game 5: Alex Pietrangelo scored game-tying goal (his first of the playoffs, assisted by Jaden Schwartz), Blues lost 3-2 in OT.
Game 6: Blues lost 2-1, eliminated from playoffs.





2014 Round 1 Blues vs. Blackhawks (defending Stanley Cup champions)
Game 1: Steen scored game-winning goal in OT.
Game 2: Jackman scored game-winning goal.
Game 3: Blues outshot Blackhawks by nine, got shut out.
Game 4: Blues blew 3-2 lead late in third period, lost 4-3.
Game 5: Pietrangelo scored game-tying goal (his first of the playoffs, assisted by Schwartz), Blues lost 3-2 in OT.
Game 6: ???





I'm not saying the Blues will fall today. Certainly, I wouldn't bet on a 2-1 final. And would never predict that the Hawks will score the game winner on a 70-foot shot from center ice in the second period.





But the over-under on the game is 5 and gaming sites recommend taking the under.





Let's Go Blues.
