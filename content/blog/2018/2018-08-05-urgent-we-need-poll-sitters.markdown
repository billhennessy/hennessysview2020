We need poll sitters. **Poll workers for Dottie Bailey for Missouri House District 110. Eureka, Pacific, and Wildwood.**







The job is easy. Wear a Dottie Bailey t-shirt in front of a polling place. As voters approach, say "Thank you for coming out to vote today, and we appreciate your support for Dottie Bailey.







### Why Dottie







Dottie is the true conservative, grassroots activist in the race. Her primary opponent is an old nemesis of the Tea Party. This was Speaker Tim Jones's old seat currently held by Rep. Kirk Mathews. We cannot afford to lose this critical seat to the RINO of Rockwood.
