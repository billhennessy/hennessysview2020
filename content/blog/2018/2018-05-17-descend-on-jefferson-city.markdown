It's time. 







Powerful and **corrupt people want to undo the 2016 election.** In Washington. In Missouri.







**Win or lose, Americans deal with the results of elections**. Our commitment to open, public government, of the people, by, the people, for people, has sustained this nation. And made it the greatest nation in the history of humanity.







But **dark forces in Missouri** want to turn your government into their private club. A club managed by corrupt business who rely on tax dollars to keep their failed enterprises afloat. A club that launders your tax dollars into their bulging pockets.







Those dark forces didn't like the results of the 2016 election. And they're trying to reverse the results through racketeering, influence, and corrupt activities. 







**Crooked businessmen paid for a fraudulent prosecution** of Missouri's Republican governor after Greitens cut $150 million in tax credits from the Missouri budget. The crooks are out for revenge. And tax dollars.







Whether you're a Greitens supporter or not, you probably realize that the **motivations and methods of his persecutors are un-American** and immoral. Love him or hate him, Greitens is the victim of the Missouri Swamp.







A coalition of republican-democracy-loving Missouri will deliver a message to the Missouri legislature. And to the crooks who fund their campaigns. **Peaceful, meaningful, and purposeful**. We'll descend on the state capital to let the wavering legislators know: we own this government.
