Somewhere in my 16 years of Catholic school education I must have heard of Michelangelo di Caravaggio. But I don't remember. Probably because art always bored me. Not that there's anything wrong with paintings and sculptures. I'm not saying that. It's just that I never got what's so great about staring all day at a picture. 

Until I saw Caravaggio's Deposition (Entombment) of Christ.
