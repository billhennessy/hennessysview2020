Elect Hawley. 







Retire that **wicked witch of the swamp McCaskill** so you can walk with a little pride, Missouri. 







**I am 100% voting proudly for Josh Hawley** for US Senate, and you will too. 







No need to say more. Vote for Hawley all the way and silently wonder what's wrong with anyone who doesn't. (There's something wrong. Say a prayer for them.)







I repeat: **Hennessy's for Hawley 100%. **
