GM announced 14,700 layoffs across the US and Canada today. The layoffs will allow GM to focus on self-driving cars, ride sharing, and electric vehicles.

To some, the announcement is proof that fully autonomous cars are on their way and that individual ownership of cars is dead. 

But, should people look to GM to plan for the future? Put another way, is GM today any smarter than the GM that required a massive taxpayer bailout a decade ago? 

### The Answer Is "No"

To both questions, the anwswer is no. For two reasons:

1. GM is too big to fail, and too-big-to-fail companies have zero skin in the game. They do not suffer consequences from their bad decsions. They only get the upside of their good decisions. (Sometimes they even profit from their bad decisions and are, threfore, incented to make more bad decisions.)
2. Autonomous, communally-own cars are not necessarily a certain future. Neither are electric vehicles. 

### Too Big to Faile

GM is a failed business. It exists only because the government couldn't stomach the idea of letting GM succumb to its own mistakes. Like a parent who bails out his addicted adult child, the federal government rewarded GM management and shareholders by deflect the consequences of a failed business to innocent US taxpayers. 

Specifically, the government forced Gen Xers and Millennials to take on 50 years of accummulated GM debt. 

What did GM learn from this embarrassing and immoral transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich? If you say "nothing," you're wrong. 

GM learned that failure is profitable. By GM, I mean GM shareholders, managers, employees, unions, and even some suppliers. 

Shareholders, managers, employees, and unions were bailed out at the expense of bondholders, which is the exact opposite of the contract for each instrument. So shareholders are willing to let GM management take crazy risks knowing the government will bail them out if the risk is realized. Of course, if the risk is not realized, if the gamble pays off, then shareholders get all the profit and the US taxpayers get none. 

GM suppliers know that the government will pay the company's unpaid bills. Such suppliers who demand proof of creditworthiness from most customers lend to GM knowing its debts are essentially government bonds. Unless the US government goes under, the bill will be paid. So suppliers, too, want GM to roll the dice since they stand to share in the upside on the remote chance of winning. 


### People Don't Want Autonomous Cars

The brilliant Nassem Taleb says "no getting on a plane not flown by a professional pilot." I suspect he has two reasons for this. Competence and skin in the game. A drone pilot has no skin in the game. A live pilot does. 

Taleb also points out that skin in the game is more than just getting fired. Skin means you stand to lose proportionally with the risk you introduced. The drone pilot who crashes a passenger jet losing a 135 lives might get fired, but he's lost nothing compared to the passengers who lost everything. But when Sully landed that plane on the Hudson River, his life was in the exact same danger as all of his passengers. Sully had skin in the game. 

You might expect MIT to be a big fan of self-driving cars. And maybe they are. But their research finds people are growing *less* interested in autonomous vehicles, not more interested. 

In fact, enthusiasm for fully autonomous cars has dropped almost in half since 2016. Researchers attribute the decline in interest to people actually *thinking* about the implications of autonomous cars. People realize that they want drivers to have skin-in-the-game. Computer programmers and network operators won't die if passengers in the cars they program and operate get killed. 

In a Bostonmix article about the MIT findings, *Consumers Don't Really Want Self-Driving Cars, MIT Study Finds*, the lack of enthusiasm comes down to risk and where consumers are willing to put it:

> One respondent flat out said: "I don't trust technology to the point of putting my life in its hands."

That's not to say people don't want some automation. I love my smart cruise control that keeps my car 60, 90, or 120 feet behind the car in front of me. I like lane-departure warnings and blind-spot warnings. Those are all reasonable uses of automation and safety assists. 

But I don't want code written by me or someone like me deciding whether to kill the old lady or the baby. I want the person in that horrible situation to have skin in the game. And so does everyone else. 


With all the hype around autonomous cars, you might think the MIT study is an outlier. It's not. In fact, it's just one of four major studies finding interest in autonomous vehicles is going down. Going down hard.
