Even his supporters say President Trump's speech is sometimes inelegant. Intentional or accidental, the president's word choice often triggers his enemies and sometimes confuses his many supporters. But on Friday President Trump had the best words for sure.







Talking about the possibility of Democrats seizing control of the US House of Representatives, he said, "could happen . . . could happen."







But the killer line we all must remember came next: "Don't worry about it. I'll just figure it out."







Folks, that's exactly the attitude to have between now and Wednesday morning. Don't worry about it—Donald Trump will figure it out. He always does. This is how he operates.

Sure, a Democrat win would likely trigger a financial crisis similar to 2008-2009. Democrats will repeatedly shut down the government and spend most of their time investigating the innocent and protecting the guilty. But life goes on, and President Trump makes life much better.







This is why I now spend about four times as much time and energy on prayer and spiritual reading and going to mass than I spend on keeping up with politics. God can even fix me. And no matter how bad things get, we can always become better saints. 







Vote Republican on Tuesday, but pray before that. Pray that people open their hearts to the Holy Spirit and to Jesus' example and to the Father's plan. With those things in order, appropriate actions will become obvious. The path illuminates itself. 







Happy Elections!
