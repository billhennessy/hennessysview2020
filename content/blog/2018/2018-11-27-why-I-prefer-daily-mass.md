Catholics are blessed in so many ways. Perhaps the most obvious way is the daily mass. Every day, just about anywhere on earth, you can go spend time in the presence of the body and blood, soul and divinity of Jesus Christ. If you are a Catholic in a state of grace, you can receive Him body and blood, soul and divinity in the form of the holy eucharist. 

This might seem insignificant compared to what you just read, but there's a side benefit to daily mass vs. Sunday mass: the liturgy is better. Much. 

Unless you're fortunate enough to live in a Catholic diocese and parish that push the liturgy toward the sacred and avoid the profane, your Sunday mass experience probably involves bad music poorly performed (instead of sacred music performed with reverence), the same boring Psalms repeated Sunday after Sunday (instead of presecribed Psalm from the official lectionary), and an elaborate homily with props and gimmicks (instead of a truthful examination on the Gospel, readings, and psalm which are designed to go together). 

But if you go to daily mass, you find something very different: a short, sacred liturgy focused on one thing: Christ. The daily mass strips away the ugly festoonary so many parishes slap onto the Sunday mass. The daily mass is simply coming together to receive our daily bread. No mediocre and profane music with theologically questionable lyrics. Just the mass. 

Some weeks I get to the Daily Mass three or four days. Other weeks, I'm limited to once or twice. I find that the more daily masses I go to, the more patient I am with the Sunday mass. 

As Advent begins, I think I'm going to pray for two things as we await the celebration of Christ's birth:

1. That I so organize my days and weeks to attend daily mass more often, and
2. That our parishes and diocese consciously make Sunday mass liturgy and music beautiful again. 

Perhaps parish liturgical committees could [learn from the Benedictines at St. Meinrad Archabbey](https://www.hennessysview.com/posts/2018/2018-11-25-st-meinrad-archabbey-mass/).
