Voters in House District 110 are asking why they received such a "disgusting" flyer from candidate Matt Doell.

Answer: Probably because he's losing badly.

Matt Doell has decided to get dirty. And personal. And mean. (Horrible internals?)

While **Dottie Bailey has knocked doors, attended coffees, and generally met with voters,** Matt Doell rubbed elbows with hot-shots and union bosses and avoided anything that looks like an "ordinary person." Like you.

Now, with a week to go in the campaign, **Doell** is flooding mailboxes with **a desperate series of personal, ad-hominem attacks** on his opponent. Disgusting, indeed. Should we call him "Disgusting Doell" or "Droopy Doell."

(I kinda like Droopy.)

After I reminded voters of Matt [**Doell's weak public record**](https://www.hennessysview.com/2018/07/31/bad-judgment-rockwood-school-board/), Doell got personal.

It's a shame that **Doell would droop to this level**. Sad, really.

Luckily, Dottie is getting tons of text messages, emails, and phone calls from strangers telling her Doell's sleazy tactics had the opposite effect: Everybody in Wildwood, Eureka, and Pacific is voting for Dottie.

From a 110th Voter like you:



> Stay strong! I did see the flyer and it disgusted me . . . Make this a learning moment keep it relevant to your mission and **thank him for showing his true colors**.  Sending hugs.



What color is sleaze?

If you're tired of sleazy politicians like Doell**, vote for Dottie on August 7. **
