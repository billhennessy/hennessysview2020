The Kavanaugh thing. I think it's all a lie. Everything. 







I've been around Democrats and progressives too long. I've seen them. I've had one live in my house. You underestimate the depths of their hatred for America. They hate it. They hate us. They especially hate themselves. 







When you hate yourself, nothing is beneath you. 







When you hate yourself, you debase yourself. 







When you hate yourself, you are capable and willing to do anything.







Anything at all. 







Therefore, I believe Christina Ford's story is a complete lie. 







Sadly, it's a lie that will achieve its intended outcome. Kavanaugh's nomination will be withdrawn before Thursday. 







I believe her "repressed memory," exposed only to a fellow psychology professor, is fabricated. I believe that the therapist's notes were manufactured after the fact and back-dated. All lies.







I believe Ford's polygraph is a lie. It's easy to fool a polygraph, and psychologists know how. Ford is a psychologist. If she's any good at all at psychology, polygraphs would be child's play to her.







I believe it's all a lie inspired by the father of lies to stop an orthodox Catholic from reaching the Supreme Court. 







I also believe the Most Holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary is our only weapon in this battle against evil.







The Rosary is a powerful weapon, on that the saints agree. From St. Dominic to Sts. John Paul II and Mother Teresa, the weapon of choice in every battle with the devil is the Rosary. 







> When the dragon saw that he had been hurled to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child. 14 The woman was given the two wings of a great eagle, so that she might fly to the place prepared for her in the wilderness, where she would be taken care of for a time, times and half a time, out of the serpent’s reach. 15 Then from his mouth the serpent spewed water like a river, to overtake the woman and sweep her away with the torrent. 16 But the earth helped the woman by opening its mouth and swallowing the river that the dragon had spewed out of his mouth. 17 **Then the dragon was enraged at the woman and went off to wage war against the rest of her offspring—those who keep God’s commands and hold fast their testimony about Jesus**.
> 
> —Revelation 12:13-17







The devil hates the rosary and all who say it. **The devil hates the rosary because it leads souls straight to Jesus,** the devil's enemy, through Mary, the woman who crushes the devil's head.







The devil attacks people who "keep God's commands and hold fast their testimony about Jesus." The devil despises the woman who evaded Satan's lies and empty promises, the woman who bore the Messiah to rule the earth.







Democrats are like the dragon waiting for the woman of Revelation to give birth. And, out of nowhere, some woman claims this man exposed himself before in college. No one believes her. Even her best friend from college. No one believes Debbie Ramirez, not even Roman Farrow who wrote her story. 







But Judge Kavanaugh is finished. Chuck Grassley and the Republican "leadership" caved in. **Once Grassley caved on the Friday deadline, you knew that Kavanaugh's Borking was complete**. By showing weakness, Grassley opened the door to more lies. 







A few Republican Senators will quietly advise the White House they cannot vote for Kavanaugh even though they know he's innocent. President Trump will throw a Twitter-tantrum, but he will have no choice but to withdraw the nomination. Two defections are all that's needed for the lie to work its magic.







And Trump's next nominee might very well face a Democrat majority in the Senate. A majority that will be too busy removing Trump from office to bother with a Supreme Court vacancy. 







If things turn out differently, thank the Blessed Mother and Jesus. Prayer works.
