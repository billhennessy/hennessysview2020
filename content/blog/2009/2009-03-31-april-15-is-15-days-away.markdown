Obama and his minions want to tell you how much you can make, how much water your toilet can flush, where you can work, what career you may pursue, where your kids can go to school, what your college-age kids can major in, the kind of toilet paper you can use, how many sheets of copy paper you may use in a month, and what you can name your children.  Don't bother arguing with me--all of these controls are in place in European "democracies" or Canada.  And the left want them here, in your country.  

I'd rather be dead.
