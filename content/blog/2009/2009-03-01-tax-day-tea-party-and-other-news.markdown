**Repeal the Pork and Learn the Constitution**

Start planning for an enormous protest on July 4, 2009.  While this is a ways off, it's already late for planning and gaining commitments from friends, neighbors, co-workers, small business owners, and the community.  For one year, do the noble work of preserving the Republic on this holiday.  

I Hate to Ask, but . . .

To keep up with everything, I've incurred some unplanned expenses.  If you would like to help defray some of these costs, please use the donation tool in the right sidebar.  All donation will go toward past or future event and movement related expenses.
