**Obama to Give Gitmo Terrorists Welfare and Home in the USA**

 

From The [Weekly Standard](https://www.weeklystandard.com/weblogs/TWSFP/2009/03/welfare_for_freed_gitmo_detain.asp):

 

>   
> 
> Some of the detainees, deemed non-threatening, may be released into the United States as free men, Blair confirmed.
> 
>    
> 
> That would happen when they can't be returned to their home countries, because the governments either won't take them or the U.S. fears they will be abused or tortured. 
> 
>    
> 
> **Blair said the former prisoners would have [to] get some sort of assistance to start their new lives in the United States.**

No, but we can tell our wounded warriors to pay for their own medical treatment. Gateway Pundit has more on this [OUTRAGE](https://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2009/03/unreal-welfare-for-gitmo-detainees.html).

 

**Obama Giving Himself Access to Your Hard Drive**

 

You won’t see this reported in the communist press in the USA. Obama is planning to spy on your computer activity:

If you want to know what life will be like in 4 years, read "The Gulag Archipelago" by Alexander Solzhenitsyn. 

 

**Missouri Governor Nixon Accused of Gestapo Tactics and Intimidation**

 

Remember the Missouri report that warned law enforcement officers to treat [conservatives as terrorists](https://hennessysview.com/2009/03/22/according-to-missouri-governor-jay-nixon-im-probably-a-terrorist-and-so-are-you/)? Well, [the blogger who broke that story](https://mopns.com/2009/03/26/nixon-henchman-intimidate-citizen-who-filed-sunshine-request/) claims that Governor Jay Nixon has sent the Missouri Highway Patrol after him and his friends in a show of brute force intimidation.

 

If this is true, Nixon must be removed from office immediately and prosecuted. If it’s untrue, then the blogger owes a big round of apologies.
