I did not watch America's Toxic Asset on 60 Minutes for the same reason I've never read "Mein Kampf."  Some people's words do not deserve my ear.

I find it interesting, though, that Mr. Obama's 90 minute interview on a program called "60 Minutes" so eerily parallels his budget:  he consumed 150 percent of what was available.

To those who watched our dictator-in-the-making, I ask a question, the answer to which should demonstrate that watching the propaganda piece was useles:  what did you learn that you didn't know before?
