My hat's off to Bob Anders and the crew from [Creative Video Services](https://www.creativevideostl.com/) for this 3-part series of the St. Louis Nationwide Chicago Tea Party protest held February 27, 2009.  If you need videography, you can't go wrong with Creative Video.

*UPDATES*

1.  It was a 3-part, not 4-part video. Sorry, my math.
