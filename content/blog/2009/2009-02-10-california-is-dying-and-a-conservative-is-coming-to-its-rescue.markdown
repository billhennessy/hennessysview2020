Former eBay CEO—and [conservative](https://lawandmore.typepad.com/law_and_more/2009/01/ca-gov-race-can-conservative-meg-whitman-take-on-uber-liberal-brown.html)—Meg Whitman has had enough.

 

She’s watch liberalism turn California into America’s Iceland.

 

She’s running for governor.

 

Maybe she’s the next Reagan. Or Thatcher.

> Whitman built eBay from a tiny start-up to the dominant online auctioneer. She will face at least one other Republican tech exec in the battle for the party nomination -- Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner.
