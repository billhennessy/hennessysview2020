The [USGS ](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/eqcenter/)reports a strong, 6.3 earthquake in Central Italy [[map of quake]](https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=42.4228,13.3945(M6.3+-+Central+Italy+-+2009+April+6+01:32:42+UTC)&t=h&z=7).  No news on major news sites yet.

UPDATE:  [Fox News ](https://foxnews.com)now has banner but no story.

UPDATE:  Fox News [moves fast](https://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,512623,00.html). From Sky News Service quoting Rafael Abreu Hael of U.S. Geological Survey:


> "This is a significant earthquake," he said. "This is a shallow quake but there is definitely a possibility of damage and even injuries. It is going to depend on what type of buildings are in the area."


Location not far from Rome which felt the quake.

More from [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSTRE53506120090406), but still few details on damage or injuries.  Hopefully none.

UPDATE:  4/6, 7:56 AM:  Reuters reports that an Italian scientist who predicted the earthquake in January was muzzled by the government.  The Italian government ordered seismologist Gioacchino Giuliani to remove all references to his prediction from the internet after the mayor of L'Aquila complained that Giulani's prediction was creating a panic.

This is not the first time governments have ostricized scientists who accurately predicted earthquakes.  The US Geological Survey fired [Jim Berkland](https://newsgroups.derkeiler.com/Archive/Sci/sci.geo.earthquakes/2006-01/msg00363.html) in the 197os, then launched a PR campaign to ridicule the man whose prediction accuracy far exceeds that of the USGS.  Berkland's predictions, it seems, fall outside of the scientific consensus.
