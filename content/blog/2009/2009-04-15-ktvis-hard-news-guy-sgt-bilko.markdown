Just watch.  And laugh.  Then call KTVI's General Manager, Spencer Koch at 314-213-2222, and demand an apology for Sgt. Bilko's latest travesty reported on [Gateway Pundit](https://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2009/04/breaking-st-louis-news-accuses-tea.html).

Too good to be true?  Ask Charles:  [cjaco@charlesjaco.com](https://mailto:cjaco@charlesjaco.com).

On April 13, Charles Jaco reported on KTVI News that an organization called The Constitution Party sponsored and helped organize the St. Louis Tea Party.  Jaco also claimed that The Constitution Party is a white supremacist group.  Despite no evidence of either claim, and the indisputible fact that The Constitution Party had no hand in the St. Louis Tea Party, Jaco persists with his lie and KTVI management refuses to apologize.
