"Absurd" is the perfect word.

Obama personifies absurdity. Take this headline for example:

**Obama Seeks to Lower Expectations** (WSJ, 2/19/2009)

Trust me, Mr. President; my expectations of you could not get any lower.

Or this:

**House Passes Tax on Wall St. Bonuses** (WSJ, 2/19/2009)

The first Bill of Attainder in a century will sail through the courts because there are very few judges or justices who know Article I from Timbuktu.

And yet:

**Cuomo Gets List of AIG Bonus Recipients **(WSJ, 2/19/2009)

Two companies, now the property of the American Soviet, surrendered private information about their employees to the Central Committee.
