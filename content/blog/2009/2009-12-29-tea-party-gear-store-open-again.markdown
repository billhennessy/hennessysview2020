](https://hennessysview.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/TEAcap_tn.png) Sorry for the interruption, but we’ve [worked out the kinks](https://stlouisteaparty.com/get-tea-party-gear/).

 

Do you want to show the world your colors?

 

Do you want to say, “[I’m a tea partier](https://stlouisteaparty.com/get-tea-party-gear/)?”

 

Do you want your style to shout, “FREEDOM!”

 

Then get to the official [St. Louis Tea Party store](https://stlouisteaparty.com/get-tea-party-gear/) and stock up. We’ve added T.E.A. ball caps to go with the T.E.A Special Forces t-shirts (our best seller).

 

You’ll look terrific reading [Zen Conservatism](https://www.createspace.com/3417300) in your [Tea Party Hoodie](https://stlouisteaparty.com/get-tea-party-gear/)!
