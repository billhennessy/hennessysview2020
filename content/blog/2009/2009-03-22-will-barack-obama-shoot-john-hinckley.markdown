The speed with which Barack Obama has seized—is seizing—private enterprise amazes even radical conservatives like me. Quite honestly, I am losing confidence in anyone’s ability to stop him from making the United States into a hip version of the old Soviet Union. In his first 100, Barack Obama will have transformed the US government, completely erasing Ronald Reagan’s presidency—as it the 80s never happened.

 

The [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/22/us/politics/22regulate.html) piece gives a great example. This week, Obama will seize power to approve, reject, or rewrite private employment contracts. In other words, business people no longer work for their boards, but for the federal government. Reagan’s ideal of limited government—shared with Jefferson, Adams, Madison, Washington, and countless other founders—has been more than reversed.

 

Then there was the Iran video in which Obama essentially capitulated to the world’s largest terrorist state. While Reagan’s mere presence in the Oval Office frightened the Ayatollah into submission, Obama gave the present regime new legitimacy and power. For its part, Iran said, “Let us finish our nukes and obliterate Israel.” Obama has not said “no.”

 

Finally, Obama’s budget is not a budget but a down-payment on true socialism of the Soviet-bloc, not UK, type. His [deficits](https://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2009/03/less-than-100-days-into-administration.html), funded with inflationary policies at the all-powerful Treasury department, will continue the economic crisis permanently, allowing him to tell us that “only government can save us now.” Can wage and price controls be far off?

 

In his [first 100](https://www.usnews.com/articles/news/history/2009/03/12/the-first-100-days-reagan-pushed-his-agenda-of-tax-cuts-and-less-government_print.htm), Reagan reversed the massive and rapid growth of government intrusion into our lives. Reagan’s results and methods were so effective that even Democrat Bill Clinton happily signed into law a sweeping reform of entitlement programs 10 years later. In less than 100 days, Obama has restored the socialist dream to Washington, devaluing hard work, thrift, and individual liberty.

 

One wonders if Obama will put the finishing touches on his anti-Reagan motif by shooting John Hinckley Jr. on March 30.
