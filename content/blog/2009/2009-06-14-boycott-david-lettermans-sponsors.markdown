If you don't know why, then you're reading the wrong blog.

[The New Agenda](https://thenewagenda.net/2009/06/10/letterman-doesnt-stop-contact-these-sponsors/) is keeping tabs on sponsors of David Letterman's show. Â I have already told T-Mobile that I will cancel may $120 month service (paying the penalty) if they don't stop advertising on The Late Show by July 15.

Top names on the boycott list:



	  * Johnson & Johnson
	  * T-Mobile
	  * Ford
	  * Nissan/Infiniti
	  * Toyota/Lexus
	  * Proctor & Gamble
	  * Citigroup (which should be out of business, anyway)
	  * Chase (JPMC)
	  * The Gap (plus Old Navy and Banana Republic)
	  * Wyeth
	  * Saturn
	  * Hotels.com
	  * Mazda

Please check the list and avoid these companies until they leave Letterman or Letterman retires.
