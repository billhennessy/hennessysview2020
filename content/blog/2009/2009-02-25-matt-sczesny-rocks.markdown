Great coverage of the St. Louis Tea Party on KMOV Channel 4 by reporter [Matt Sczesny](https://www.beloblog.com/KMOV_Blogs/reportersblog/2009/02/the-st-louis-tea-party.html).  

Channel 4 has not posted the video (that I can find). [ I'll link or embed it as soon as it's available](https://www.kmov.com/video/topvideo-index.html?nvid=335682).

Please say "thanks" to Matt and KMOV for a fair report.

Amy at Top Conservatives on Twitter has put together a convenient list of the [Tea Parties across the country](https://tcotreport.com/MasterTeaPartyInfo.html).  This list is NOT exhaustive, as not all cities have a Facebook Event page.  

If you have friends and family in other cities, please encourage them to attend their local rally.  And remember, this is an exhibition, not a competition; please, no wagering.  (h/t Letterman)

For our local St. Louis theme, I really, really like the Red:  the blood of the patriots.  We represent that vast stretch of land filled with strong, working people who rush to the shores when our Republic is threatened.  We stand tall against enemies foreign and domestic.  We bandage our wounds and march on, ever forward, ever humble, yet ever certain of our purpose.  

Red-stained guaze around our heads, red sweaters on our chests, the river at our backs, the Great Frontier before us.  St. Louis was the far side of the America's Rubicon.  All who travel there on Friday will set themselves on the trail to a future under the torch of our brilliant past.   

When Ben Franklin left Consitution Hall after the delegates had finally ratified the document that forever changed man's relationship to government, a citizen shouted, "Dr. Franklin, what have wrought us?"  

Franklin replied simply, "A Republic . . . if you can keep it." 

To hear our President doubt our steel, question our resolve, and deny our ability to right ourselves and help our neighbor without some immense government to guide us is to hear that Philadelphia citizen shout back at Franklin, "Can you keep it for us?" 

Our red shirts tell Franklin, "Just watch."
