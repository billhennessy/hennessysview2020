**Rumor: Jay Nixon Shutting Down Transparency**

 

Rumor has it that Governor Jay Nixon plans to shut down the [Missouri Accountability Portal ](https://mapyourtaxes.mo.gov/MAP/Portal/Default.aspx)to hide his fiscial activities. The Portal, hailed as the international [model of government transparenc](https://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/taxonomy/term/missouri-accountability-portal/)y, allows citizens to see the check register of every penny spent by state government. Governor Matt Blunt started the portal as tool allow the people to police Missouri government, so why on Earth would Nixon close it? Tea Partiers should [write the Governor](https://governor.mo.gov/contact/) and their local newspapers, radio and television stations demanding more transparency, not less.
