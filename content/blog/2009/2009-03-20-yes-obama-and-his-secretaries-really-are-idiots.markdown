The new Secretary of Homeland Security has replaced the word "terrorism" with "[man-caused disasters](https://ace.mu.nu/archives/284583.php)."

I assume that appointing an idiot like Napolitano to the cabinet qualifies as a man-cause disaster.

On that note, Eric Holder said that he intends to [free Gitmo terrorists in the US](https://hotair.com/archives/2009/03/19/ready-to-welcome-your-friendly-neighborhood-gitmo-terrorist/). Obama hopes to isolate Israel.

Put it all together and it's safe to say that Al Qaeda accomplished a lot more of its goals at the ballot box last November than it did with the 9-11 attacks.

Congrats, Osama.

Oh, and [Obama LOVES Iran](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/first100days/2009/03/19/obama-reaches-iran-looks-engagement/). And makes fun of the [Special Olympics](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/03/19/obama-tells-leno-stunned-aig-bonuses/). (He was teleprompter-challenged.)

Hey, Christo Buckley--how does it feel to have voted for the destruction of Western Civilization?
