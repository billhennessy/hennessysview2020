Go Dana.  How 'bout a little equal time?  Why does the WU prof get 80 percent of the time?

DELETED VIDEO EMBED

I detest videos that start automatically.  

You can see the report on KSDK's web site.  Not the best coverage, certainly not fair, but publicity is publicity.  So thanks to Rebecca for visiting with Dana and selecting 7 seconds of the interview to air ahead of 30 minutes of some college professor who wrote a book in his spare time.  (I wrote mine while I was in the Navy.)
