I dwell on this too much, but my new ebook--[Zen Conservatism--is now available](https://wp.zenconservatism.com/store/#ecwid:category=151234&mode=product&product=313707). Currently, you'll have to pay by[![ZenCon235x195](https://stlouisteaparty.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/ZenCon235x195.png)
](https://wp.zenconservatism.com/store/#ecwid:category=151234&mode=product&product=313707)Google Checkout.

 

The hard launch is scheduled for Monday, December 14, but I wanted to make the ebook available to St. Louis Tea Partiers early AND at a discount of only $6.50. (It will go up to $9.50 on Monday.)

 

In addition to the [Zen Conservatism ebook](https://wp.zenconservatism.com/store/#ecwid:category=151234&mode=product&product=313707), you can register now to become [Happier, Healthier, and More Effective in just 3 Minutes a Day](https://wp.zenconservatism.com/3-surefire-ways-to-be-happier-healthier-and-more-effective-in-3-5-minutes-a-day/). Become a Positive Journalist on [zenconservatism.com.](https://wp.zenconservatism.com/) Read this article and follow the links inside. My goal is to have 1,000 people enter 30 positive stories before St. Patrick's Day. You can start today, even without buying a book. (Offer will end soon, so hurry if you want to blog without registering.)

 

Finally, thank you, all of you, for the most amazing year of my life. I start writing this book a week after the 2008 elections. I was writing to myself at first, but then I heard so much fear and anger that I decided to make it a book. Then the Tea Party started, and . . . well, I just didn't have the time to finish it. I took some time off of the Tea Party in October to dust off the file and wrap it up. I hope you like it. I know some of you will disagree with parts of it, and some might be disappointed with my honesty. I can't help that--I don't think you'd want me any other way.

 

Thanks,*
Bill
