Bill Clinton began his presidency in a recession, promising to make a middle class tax cut and more jobs his laser-beam focus.  But first, he let gays into the military and sent his wife off to socialize medicine. 

Barack Obama began his presidency during a borderline depression, promising to save the country from economic collapse, lowering the seas, and scripting quality endings to Stephen King's movies.  But first, he symbolically flipped off [everyone affected](https://michellemalkin.com/2009/01/20/about-that-race-based-benediction/) by Islamofascist terrorists,[ snubbed military heroes](https://ace.mu.nu/archives/281532.php), and[ redifined ethics](https://justoneminute.typepad.com/main/2009/01/geithner---ethi.html) as the way one behaves when the whole world's watching.

Good government, like good medicine, begins with refraining from inflicting damages on the patient--in this case, the American people whom Obama theoretically serves.

If his first day and a half are any indication of the way he intends to rule (and I mean "rule"), then he is certain to go down as our first despotic president.  

**Suspending Terror Trials and Closing Gitmo**

I am trying not to be angry.  Nothing would be served by calling the President of the United States a smug, arrogant, communist, mutherfuker who isn't fit chew the used toilet paper of the lowliest Purple Heart recipient.  So I won't do that.  Nor would it help to remind readers that Obama has espoused communist doctrine for at least a decade.  So we'll skip that.  And would purpose would be served in pointing out that Obama would have been creamed in the primaries were he not half black?  None.  So I won't do that.  Nor will I point out that the NAACP might have taken exception to Rev. Billy Graham [praying that the black man will embrace work](https://michellemalkin.com/2009/01/20/about-that-race-based-benediction/).  

What I will say is that Obama either hates the American people and all we stand for, or he is really, really stupid.  The Gitmo executive orders will define his presidency.  When a dirty nuke blows up in Manhattan or weaponized disease strains Kansas's hospitals, we will point to these two, first actions as the eminating documents of a new wave of terrorism.  Will be both correct and justified in doing so.  

**A Long 4 Years**

Should The One or any member of his Supreme Soviet stumple upon these pages, may they take away this bit of advice: if the economy is so bad, make that your first priority; if terrorists are so cool, you should have run on that message.

And while you're here, please tell the President that I, for one, hope his presidency is a miserable failure but that the country somehow survives.
