[Rasmussen's](https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/obama_administration/daily_presidential_tracking_poll) daily Presidential Approval Tracking numbers continue to show that Obama has lost more support in his first 50 days than any president since polling began.

Among the many factors contributing to Obama's falling popularity, in my view, is his [scattershot](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/barackobama/4991247/Barack-Obamas-aides-admit-errors-are-making-him-less-popular.html) approach to the economy, inability to recruit and retain talent, and strong leftward lurch since taking office.

Americans do not want socialism. I hear over and over from disenchanted Obama voters that they didn't believe he was a leftist as some on the right made him out to be during the campaign. But now they realize we were right, as usual.

Rasmussen has [an interesting new interactive poll](https://rasmussenreports.predictify.com/p/rasmussenreports/q/what-will-barack-obamas-approval-index-be-on-april-2?results&prd=1): What will Obama's approval rating be on April 30?
