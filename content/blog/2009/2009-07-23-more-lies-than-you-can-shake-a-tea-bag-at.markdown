[Excerpts of Obama’s Remarks Prepared for News Conference - Washington Wire - WSJ](https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2009/07/22/excerpts-of-obamas-remarks-prepared-for-news-conference/)  


> Excerpts of the President’s Opening Remarks at Tonight’s News Conference  
President's words in bold. Patriotic response in _italics_.  
**  
That is why I’ve said that even as we rescue this economy from a full-blown crisis**  
_Obama promised to stop unemployment below 8 percent if stimulus passed. Stimulus passed and unemployment now 9.7 percent heading to 12 percent. If he rescues healthcare like he rescued the economy, we'll all be dead._  
  
**This is not just about the 47 million Americans who have no health insurance. **  
_Thirty million of whom are ILLEGAL-FRIGGIN-ALIENS!_  
  
**And it’s about the fact that the biggest driving force behind our federal deficit is the skyrocketing cost of Medicare and Medicaid.**  
_Then get rid of Medicare and Medicaid! They are both UNCONSTITUTIONAL, Vladimir!_  
  
**So let me be clear: if we do not control these costs, we will not be able to control our deficit. **  
_Really? You quadrupled the deficit in 120 days, you pencil-neck geek! The CBO and every economist outside the West Wing says your socialized medicine scheme will add at least a quarter trillion to that deficit!!!!!! STOP LYING, OBAMA!_  
  
**I realize that with all the charges and criticisms being thrown around in Washington, many Americans may be wondering, “What’s in this for me? How does my family stand to benefit from health insurance reform?”**  
_No we're not, you twit. We're asking, "When the hell did America become a communist country?" We're asking, "Why can't we hold a no-confidence vote like the Brits?" We're asking, "Who in the name of God voted for this wicked fool?"_  
  
**If you already have health insurance, the reform we’re proposing will provide you with more security and more stability. **  
_BULLS**T!!!!_   
  
**It will keep government out of health care decisions, giving you the option to keep your insurance if you’re happy with it. **  
_LIAR! One new bureaucracy, the National Coordinator of Health Information Technology, will monitor treatments to make sure your doctor is doing what the federal government deems appropriate and cost effective. The goal is to reduce costs and “guide” your doctor’s decisions ([pp. 442, 446](https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601039&sid=aLzfDxfbwhzs))._  
  
**It will prevent insurance companies from dropping your coverage if you get too sick. **  
_Unless you're old or infirm (Obama's words)--then you die._  
  
_In reality, you will go to jail unless you buy government's plan (House Bill pp. 167-168)._  
  
**I have also pledged that health insurance reform will not add to our deficit over the next decade – and I mean it.**  
_LIAR!!! You said that unemployment would not pass 8 percent! You said you would not raise any tax on anyone making less than $250,000! STOP LYING, YOU WEASEL!!!_  
…  
  
Folks, Barack Obama is the bold socialist ever to occupy the White House. If you do not leave the comfort of your home, the relaxation of your damn television, the seat at the ball game to get out into the streets and fight for your freedom like a rabid dog, then you deserve the toilet of a life you'll get. But, dammit, you have business dragging down me, my kids, and the good people who HAVE taken to the streets, written letters, called radio stations for our and your freedom.   
  
Our friend in O'Fallon, MO, would like to organize DAILY PROTESTS FROM NOW UNTIL WE WIN BACK THIS COUNTRY!!! We will blog about this soon. Please get your sign made and your marching shoes on. Go stand on a corner with your sign tonight!!! What the hell is stopping you???????  
  
MARCH! FIGHT! YELL! MAKE THE LEFT APOLOGIZE FOR ONCE!!!!!!!
