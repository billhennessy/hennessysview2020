The DUers are really torn over Michael Crichton's book, "State of Fear." Many of them clearly [don't want you or anyone else to read the book](https://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&address=115x17810#17818). ("Once I put it down, I just couldn't pick it up!")




Others try to arm readers with information to [counter Crichton's charges ](https://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&address=115x17810)in the book. The counter-arguments are miserably lame and usually non-responsive to the charge. In other words, "we know we're wrong, so change the subject." 




Still,[ others side with Crichton](https://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=show_mesg&forum=115&topic_id=17728&mesg_id=17728), declaring global warming--at least as caused by human activity--horsefeathers.




I'm with the last of these.
