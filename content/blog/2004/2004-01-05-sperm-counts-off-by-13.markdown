I found this on [Drudge](https://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/afp/20040105/hl_afp/britain_health_sperm_040105105306). I offer a contrarian explanation, however. Perhaps the feminization of men--mandatorily sitting to urinate in pre-schools, supporting Howard Dean--is reducing the amount of testosterone men produce. I'd like to see a study that measures the sperm count in deficient men before and after a weekend movie marathon of The Godfather I and II, Patton, Braveheart, The Patriot (Mel Gibson's), and Band of Brothers (all 10 episodes). For kicks, throw in Planes, Trains, and Automobiles, Animal House, and My Cousin Vinny.

My prediction is that these men will produce an overabundance of sperm for the next three weeks.
