A foul and acrid odor greets the nose  
and violates the shirt, the pant, the underwear  
for hours, days, weeks, unwashed.  
Plastic flip-top lid conceals  
the quartered fruit, so dry  
and old, unworthy of gin or tongue.  
Tired, sad, bilirubin-stained faces  
surround the parallelogram   
giving more than they receive  
and much less than they asked for.  
Age marked in hollows, dents, and chips.  
Laughters, hard and coarse, rise above  
the jukebox boom of same old songs  
that all have heard and hummed and heard.  
The owner buys a drink for one who  
surely needs so much more
