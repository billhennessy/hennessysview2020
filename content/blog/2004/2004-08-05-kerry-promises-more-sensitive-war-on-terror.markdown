What did I tell you people a week ago? I said that, reading between the lines, Kerry will not fight bin Laden, but schmooze him. Today, he admitted as much by saying he will "fight . . . a more sensitive war on terror."




Whatever funding the Bush Administration hasn't cut off from terrorists will now be redirected to the Kerry campaign. Either way, the terrorists lose their money.
