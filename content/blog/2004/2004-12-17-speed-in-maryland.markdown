[Last week](https://blog.billhennessy.com/blogs/hennessys_view/archive/2004/12/06/460.aspx), I came across the news story about 12 homes under construction set ablaze in Maryland and used it to discuss eco-terrorism. Yesterday, [authorities arrested a man named Aaron Speed](https://apnews.myway.com/article/20041217/D871EG3O0.html). He is not known as an eco-terrorist, and apparently had no motive. Speeds works as a security guard protecting the home allegedly torched.




Something seems wrong here. While Speed has a history of mental illness, he reminds me of the guy they arrested in Atlanta for detonating a bomb during the Olympics. In that case, they got the wrong guy by overreaching in the search for a motive. Authorities believed [Richard Jewell ](https://www.historychannel.com/speeches/archive/speech_461.html)planted the bomb in order to be seen a hero. So far, no possible motive has been given for Speed to set fire to the homes.




We'll see.




From the evidence disclosed thus far, I would be surprised if Speed ever goes to trial.
