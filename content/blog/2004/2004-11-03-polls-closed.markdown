On most of the East Coast and Midwest.  At the top of the hour, projections have Kerry up 77 to 66.  South Carolina, Virginia, and North Carolina--all states where Bush is almost certain to win--are still not called.  
  
Bush is leading among the votes counted in Ohio and Florida.    
  
I don't think it will be a long night.  We should know something by 10:00 PM CST--11:00 in the east. ![](https://blog.billhennessy.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=528)
