I thought Pablo the deserter would turn out a pseudo-intelletual lefty. Well, an English major he is not.




_The qualification process for doing most of my duties is over 6 months (the length of the deployment)and so i [sic] would of [sic] mainly been training and get[t]ing qualified, which in some ways is more of a burden than assistance. It is also likely that my early out chit would have been approved after the deployment . . . _




Is it "would of" or "would have," Pablo? Actually, he used "would of" at least twice, so I guess he's sticking with option A.




Read this self-serving [bastard's idiotic response to Smash](https://www.indepundit.com/archive2/2004/12/sea_lawyer.html), and Smash's glorious rebuttal.

[Backcountry Conservative ](https://www.jquinton.com/archives/002274.html)provides a [link to another Pablo response](https://www.shortfamilyonline.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=440). While this guy lacks the time and spine to fulfill his obligation to his country, he sure has plenty of time for blogging.
