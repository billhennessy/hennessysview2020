A herd of "scientists" recently gathered in Sweden to announce a new geological era, Anthropocene, which is man's final destruction of the rest of the planet. These assembled idiots, embarrassments to whatever colleges granted them degrees, gave as an example of "catastophic" changes caused by man, sand churned up by SUVs and ATVs. Yes, dust churned up in the Sahara. 

  


Of course, these mice of science lack any actual numbers. Were they to study their own fields, they'd learn that the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883 released approxomately 11 cubic miles of dust into the atmosphere, creating a mini-nuclear winter in New York, some 6,000 miles away. On that eruption:

The volcanic dust blown into the upper atmosphere was carried several times around the earth by air currents. This volcanic dust veil not only created the spectacular atmospheric effects described previously but acted also as a solar radiation filter, reducing the amount of sunlight reaching the surface of the earth. In the year following the eruption, global temperatures were lowered by as much as 1.2 degree Centigrade on the average. Weather patterns continued to be chaotic for years and there were major climatological changes which affected the entire globe.

(It should be noted that environmentalist whackos use the year 1884 as the baseline for "proving" global warming. Why? Because the volcano made that year unusually cool around the world.)

  


Further, these scientists complain that the Amazon and Sahara could change climatological placs as a result of man's activities. Horse hockey. We learned in high school science class that the Sahara has once a fertile and temperate garden. The millenial rocking of the Earth's axis has shifted it, throughout most of man's existence, closer to the equator, scortching its forests into barren dessert. When the earth rocks back the other way (which began about 3,000 years ago), the Sahara will naturally become fertile, again. I don't remember whether the Amazon valley was once a dessert--but I remember a hell of a lot more science that the crackpots in Stockholm.

  


I have a recommendation for the scientists: re-read your freshman science books and stop using your phony degrees to advance your unscientific political agenda.

  


One scientist, physician, and environmentalist agrees, largely, with me. His name is Michael Crichton. You probably know of his work: ER, Jurassic Park, Prey. Last year he lambasted the "religion" of environmentalism which spews lies as emotional masturbation. Here's just a small piece of his speech: (Click anywhere to go to the complete speech.)

I can tell you that DDT is not a carcinogen and did not cause birds to die and should never have been banned. I can tell you that the people who banned it knew that it wasn't carcinogenic and banned it anyway. I can tell you that the DDT ban has caused the deaths of tens of millions of poor people, mostly children, whose deaths are directly attri![](https://blog.billhennessy.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=621)
