[ProfessorBainbridge.com ](https://www.professorbainbridge.com)reports that the doctor may have an insider trading scandal to deal with. Keeping score, Dean is now a hypocrite on:   * Dean wants the Bush administration to release minutes of meetings with energy executives, but he refuses to release minutes of his meetings with energy executives.   * Dean wants religion divorced from politics, but he wants to talk about what a bang-up Christian he is while campaigning in the South.   * Dean wants Bush to spend more on homeland security, but he refused to spend what was necessary to make his state's nuclear power plant safe and secure.   * Dean wants Bush to impose draconian rules to prevent stock and mutual fund abuses, but he traded stocks on insider information in 1991.

Before ridiculing the Bush administration, Dr. Dean should consult his own history.
