Well, the blogosphere's finally noticing Crichton's new book, [State of Fear](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=hennesssview-20&path=tg%2Fdetail%2F-%2F0066214130%2Fqid%3D1102908263%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fref%3Dpd_csp_1%3Fv%3Dglance%26s%3Dbooks%26n%3D507846) .




[Econopundit ](https://www.econopundit.com/archive/2004_12_01_econopundit_archive.html#110285639301022181)has some interesting data, and[ I smelled this ](https://blog.billhennessy.com/blogs/hennessys_view/archive/2003/12/16/823.aspx)coming a year ago.

UPDATE: [Dean Esmay](https://www.deanesmay.com/posts/1102929591.shtml) has a long, thoughtful piece on global warming inspired by things other than Crichton. Money quotes that match Crichton's speech at CalTech:

>> 2) Most climate scientists will affirm that atmospheric CO2 levels have been much higher at times in the past than they are now.

>> 
>> 3) There's not much evidence that CO2 levels and average atmospheric temperature are more than marginally correlated.

>> And one of the bigger bombshells of the last year was when the most commonly cited study on atmospheric temperature trends over the last millenium to demonstrate a sharp recent increase in global temperatures [_was shown to be mathematically flawed_](https://www.technologyreview.com/articles/04/10/wo_muller101504.asp).
