I thought I was the only one who distrusts John McCain. (I have not trusted him since his attacks on Pat Buchanan in which McCain knowingly advanced phony charges that Buchanan was a Nazi sympathizer. McCain did so for his own purposes and permanently destroy my faith in his character.)




Apparently, though, there are quite a few people who have reservations about the one of the Keating Five who never seems to get a mention with that group.




Like [Karol at Dean's World](https://www.deanesmay.com/posts/1093919614.shtml), I found McCain's speech last night surprising and uplifting. It cannot be portrayed as tepid, perfunctory, or utilitarian by the media. (Unless, of course, they're willing to flat out lie.)
