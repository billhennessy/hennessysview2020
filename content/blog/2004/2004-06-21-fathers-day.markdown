You sent me out.  
I resisted.  
You made me go.  
I went.  
Brian showed up  
with LeAnne.  
I broke his toe,  
played Golden Tee.  
(I lost)  
You trusted me.  
I missed you.  
I saw a room.  
You weren't there.  
I drank  
without you,  
alone  
with friends.  
You sent me out.  
I went.  
I paid and left.  
I walked.  
You made me go.  
I'm home now.  
Father's day:  
It's when a man  
understands  
that the woman  
makes the man.  
You made me.  
I resisted.  
I was wrong.  
You made me.  
I resisted.  
I'm the man.  
You made me.![](https://blog.billhennessy.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=748)
