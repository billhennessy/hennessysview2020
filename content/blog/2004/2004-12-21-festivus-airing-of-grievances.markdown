I gotta lotta problems with you people!




Bush! I understand you're still spending more money than God could print. Knock it off and cut some programs.




Rumsfeld: What the hell are you doing? Kill those radical bastards so we can move onto Iran.




Michael Moore: You're liar. And you're fat.




O'Reilly: The act is old. Find a new schtick.




Dan Rather: Quit already.
