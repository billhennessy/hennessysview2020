_Angela, I've watched you struggle to go to school and still be as good a mom as could be. I've watched you flustered, doing more work than you should, and becoming just plain tired. I'm happy you've made the decision to move on and open your world to a new and exciting career. Best of luck to you, Angie. I wish you every success!_![](https://blog.billhennessy.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=752)
