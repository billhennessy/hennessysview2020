[This is from a peace rally somewhere](https://soubriquet.net/photos/2003/feb15.php?page=19). Does this Nancyboy Junior Lefty really look he needs someone to tell him not to bully weaker kids? And do his teachers ask him whether Saddam bullied people? Perhaps he should learn about the brides Saddam's sons routinely raped on their wedding nights. Perhaps he should learn about the mass graves in Kurdish north. Perhaps he should be lifting weights instead of holding idiotic signs that make him look like a pansy.
