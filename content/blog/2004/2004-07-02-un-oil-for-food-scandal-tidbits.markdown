The stories, the facts, the meat of the case, against the United Nations are beginning to leak out. [Here is one such story from the New York Post](https://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=106&ncid=742&e=4&u=/nypost/20040702/cm_nypost/unstelltaletipoff).




Saddam used bribes to UN Officials to divert $10 billion from food and medicine for the Iraqi people to building palaces and killing people he didn't like. The UN quietly endorsed this practice.




Giving money to UN relief agencies is more than a waste: it's supporting corruption that kills innocent people. The UN must be destroyed.
