Regulars know that I rarely invoke the memory of William Jeffersonovich Clinton for the same reason I don't I say "must win situation" when the Blues are down 3 - 1 in the Stanley Cup Finals. It's a cliche.




Nonetheless, news in today's [New York Post](https://www.nypost.com/news/worldnews/36359.htm) that Marc Rich, the most controversial of Clinton's Midnight Pardons, was a major player in the Oil for Food scam with Saddam.

If true, Clinton's tarnished legacy will suffer true corrosion. In case you don't remember, Marc Rich, who was primarily wanted for evading millions in taxes, has done a lot of work to help America's enemies for his own, personal gain. By contributing large sums of illegal money through his wife to the DNC, Rich bought himself a Clinton pardon, allowing him to return to the United States.




I hope he is indicted and found guilty of these charges. Poetic justice demands that he spend the rest of his life behind bars. Perhaps a reasonable restitution would 100% of his net worth to the new Iraqi government.
