Turmoil in the Kerry campaign continues to get attention: me, Dan Rather, Howard Fineman, Al Hunt, and now [PoliBlogger](https://www.poliblogger.com/index.php?p=4509).

Again, I'm amazed at the similarities between descriptions of Kerry's campaign problems and Al Gore's four years ago. I'm sure Al Hunt and Howard Fineman mean to help Kerry with their fond descriptions of his thinking skills, but they are setting him up for failure by raising the bar too high. As they did with Gore, they are over-selling their candidate while the GOP continues to under-sell Bush.
