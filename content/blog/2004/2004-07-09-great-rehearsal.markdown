It's really coming together.  It's a great thing to see.  Thank you, everyone, for what you're doing.  You might be doing this for yourself, but your dedication is such a gift to all the rest of us who went into it for OURselves.  There is nothing better than being a part of a great team, is there?  There's something masturbatory about individual accomplishments.  Tonight reminded me of boot camp when the company finally gets the drill down: 82 boots strike the pavement as one.  Rifles move at identical angles and speeds.  A great column of marching men divides in two to form a company six abreast, all while marching forward, oblique, forward, oblique, forward, to the right flank, to the left flank.  It makes you feel invincible--as we will be next Wednesday.  ![](https://blog.billhennessy.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=701)
