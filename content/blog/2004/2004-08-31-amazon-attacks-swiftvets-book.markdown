[Professor Bainbridge](https://www.professorbainbridge.com/2004/08/amazon_annoyanc.html) has discovered another example of liberal hypocrisy. (They're so hard to find, aren't they?)




Amazon has suspended its rules of decorum for one book: Unfit for Command. The Amazon policy permits anyone to write anything about anyone--short of profanity. Presumably, one can offer cash money for the assassination of the Swift Boat Veterans with Amazon's ascent.




I was in a Border's two weeks ago where I found an aisle end cap dedicated to books on the election. There 14 titles highlighted: two pro-Kerry, one pro-Bush, and 12 anti-Bush or anti-Reagan. (They'll never get over Reagan. Therapy seems in order.)




It's too bad liberals don't have to live by their own rules on dissent.
