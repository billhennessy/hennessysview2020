[Outside the Beltway](https://www.outsidethebeltway.com/archives/8347) examines Michael Scheuer's column in Los Angeles Times.   
  
One point I'd add: The reason American people are outraged over Clinton's failure to take out Bin Laden in 1998 and 1999 is that they don't know. The press did a fine job of filtering out any criticism of the Clinton admin.   
  
Remember Howard Fineman's admission in October? That the MSM would report only bad news about Iraq until the end of the campaign? Remember that Fineman's confession came on the heels of ABC's Mark Halprin's admonishment to treat Bush unevenly?   
  
Well, Mr. Scheuer, if you want outrage, you'll have to write another book and THIS TIME tell the truth instead of sucking up to the MSM. ![](https://blog.billhennessy.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=463)
