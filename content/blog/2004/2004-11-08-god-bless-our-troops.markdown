The assault on Fallujah has begun. 10,000 of the bravest Americans and Iraqis are about test their mettle. God bless them all. May each return to his family with all of his faculties.




How dare we forget the struggles of the few for the many. May those who must fall in fighting find fast, safe passage to eternal salvation, and may they one day welcome us, the beneficiaries of the their sacrifice, into God's waiting arms.
