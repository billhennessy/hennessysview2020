AGHHH!!!! 

I HATE computers!

750 words of analysis of the unfolding story about a [Democrat senate conspiracy](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A50380-2004Jan2.html) to subvert the federal judiciary, and my computer screwed you, dear reader, out of it.

I will rewrite it if I get the energy. This is all that remains--a quote from Federalist No. 64 by John Jay:

> the President and senators so chosen will always be of the number of those who best understand our national interests, whether considered in relation to the several States or to foreign nations, who are best able to promote those interests, and whose reputation for integrity inspires and merits confidence. 
> 
> 

In summary, anyone who votes for Kennedy or Durbin, votes against democracy and freedom.
