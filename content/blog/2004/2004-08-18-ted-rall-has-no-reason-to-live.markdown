Perhaps my reaction was his intention with [ this column](https://www.commondreams.org/views04/0818-11.htm).   
  
Ted Rall is a liar who lies to promote his personal goal of inciting a violent overthrow of the United States government so he and George Soros can impose a Stalinist state.  They are, after all, working communists committed to fulfilling Lenin's dream.   
  
But that's just my opinion, as Dennis Miller days; I could be wrong. ![](https://blog.billhennessy.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=641)
