Letter to John Kerry  
  
August 25, 2004  
  
Senator John Kerry  
304 Russell Senate Office Building  
Washington, DC 20510  
  
Dear Senator Kerry,   
  
We are pleased to welcome your campaign representatives to Texas today. We honor all our veterans, all whom have worn the uniform and served our country. We also honor the military and National Guard troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan today. We are very proud of all of them and believe they deserve our full support.  
  
That
