Poor Dr. Sami Solanki. [He and his colleagues at the Institute for Astronomy in Zurich ](https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3869753.stm)have discovered that sun spot activity--which has been measured since 1610 and can be reliable tracked for a thousand years before that--has a powerful influence on the earth's temperatures. 




Moreover, the sun, they've found, has been more active in the past 60 years--which coincides with "global warming"--than any time in the past 1,000 years.




Wait until the environmentalist whackos go after this poor bastard. Apparently no one told him that when good science contradicts liberal prejudice and emotions, science be damned.




He'll find out.
