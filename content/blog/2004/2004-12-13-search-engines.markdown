What in God's holy name does the Microsoft search engine do?




I can type the exact same entry into three or four separate engines and get back, more or less, the same results. Then, I enter the same search--langa cleanxp--into MSN's search and get back goofy results. I've noticed this for a couple of years, but since launching their "new" search engine in November, the problem seems to be getting worse.
