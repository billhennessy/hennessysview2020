The 20th Century's two giant defenders of Christian faith--C.S. Lewis and G.K. Chesterton--both turned to Christianity from atheism. Chesterton fought G. B. Shaw over God's existence. C.S. Lewis fought, among others, Antony Flew. 




Flew, now 81 years old, made his name scoffing at the silliness of people who "believe in a ghost in the clouds." A professor of philosophy, Flew demanded proof of God's existence before he would believe--or let others believe unchallenged. (A common thing with atheists is the insistance that no one else believe in God, either.)




According to an Associated Press story on [ABCNews.com](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=315976), linked by [Drudge](https://www.drudgereport.com):





> 

> 
> At age 81, after decades of insisting belief is a mistake, Antony Flew has concluded that some sort of intelligence or first cause must have created the universe. A super-intelligence is the only good explanation for the origin of life and the complexity of nature, Flew said in a telephone interview from England.

Welcome to the light side, Antony. When you get to that special place, I'm sure George MacDonald, G.K. Chesterton, and Jack Lewis will have a whiskey waiting.
