According to [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/12/06/democrats.ohiovoting.ap/index.html), Ohio has certified the election.   
  
I feel sorry for the folks at DemocraticUnderground who convinced themselves that Ohio would end up in the Kerry camp and thousands of GOP voters would end up in jail.   
  
[Blogs for Bush ](https://www.blogsforbush.com/mt/archives/003109.html)has some interesting polling data.
