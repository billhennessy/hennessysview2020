23 years ago, I met Joe DiMercurio at auditions for his People's Players production of Sound of Music.  Over the next four years, he became one of my closest friends, particularly on stage.    
  
Last night, after the thrill of a wonderful opering night, still buzzing from the excitement and the energy of the play, I found out that my haste in producing the program resulted in my omitting one of my best friend's biography.  It was punch in the gut that I delivered to myself.  
  
I am sorry, Joe.  I will make it up today.    
  
Cordially,
