If you've come here in the past few days, you've noticed that my site's been down.  There are a couple of reasons:  
  
1.  I spent 24 out of 38 hours working in my family room (and, no, it wasn't a Godfather maration).  I painted, ripped out the carpet, and put in laminate flooring that looks wonderful.  In the process, I re-routed some cables and forget to reconnect them until Monday morning.    
  
2.  Six hours after I got my servers back online, massive storms moved through the St. Louis area and took my electricity with them when they moved into Illinois.  I just got that back.    
  
I apologize for the inconvenience.  If anyone would like to donate a generator, item 2 will never happen again.  ![](https://blog.billhennessy.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=711)
