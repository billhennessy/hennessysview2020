I'll resist the temptation to write specifically about Veterans' Day. As a veteran, I'm afraid anything I wrote would too self-indulgent. ;)

Instead, I'll link to [this earlier piece.](https://blog.billhennessy.com/Default.aspx?tabid=1&newsType=ArticleView&articleId=33)

National Review has [this nice piece](https://www.nationalreview.com/owens/owens200411110831.asp).
