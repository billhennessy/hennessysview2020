So, last night was Opening Night...  
I personally thought it went GREAT! The audience was very receptive--laughing and clapping when and where they should have. (And not being shy about it.) I THINK this is accurate information, but I heard that we started a few minutes late because we still had a line out the door for tickets at 7:30. (?) And that, save for 9 tickets, we were sold out (?). WOW. That is amazing. I mean, I had the confidence and knew that this was going to be big and successful, but I had no idea that it would be quite like this.  
Of course, there were just a few Opening Night snags--as there always will be. Last night we had 27 pages of notes from Mr. Leibrecht before the show, I'm wondering if we will have more or less this time around. I had to kind of laugh to myself when I saw him backstage walking around with his little hand held tape recorder and making notes into it as the show was going on. Amazing. This is the first show I have actually been in with Mr. Leibrecht--except for the one-acts my Junior year, but we were never on stage together--and even just after last night, I can't believe how fun and amusing it is. Mr. Leibrecht is like a little kid in a candy shop on stage--he completely becomes a different person (obviously, that's the point of acting)--and you can just feel how much he loves what he does and pours his heart into it. It really is a neat thing to watch and be part of.  
I can't believe we only have 3 more shows to go, though...![](https://blog.billhennessy.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=685)
