This [Jonah Goldberg piece in The Corner ](https://www.nationalreview.com/goldberg/goldberg.asp)is a classic--one to print on acid-free paper and keep in a safe place.

It is no more rational to vote based on a desire to do "good" than it is to vote based on a desire to do God's will. Indeed, for millions of people this is a distinction without a difference -- as it was for so many of the abolitionists progressives and civil-rights leaders today's liberals love to invoke but never actually learn about.
