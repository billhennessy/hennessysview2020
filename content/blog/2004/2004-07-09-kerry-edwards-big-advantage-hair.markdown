At a rally after announcing his pick for Veep, Senator John Kerry listed the things that make the Democrat ticket a better choice than the current administration. His final, and presumably, most important point:




"And we have better hair. And that goes a long way."




Perhaps if the Senator wishes us to take him seriously as a presidential candidate, he should put down the mirror, stop kissing his VP nominee, and attend the terror assessment briefings offered by the White House.




Until he starts taking seriously his responsibilities as potentially the next President of the United States, we should treat his candidacy and his party with the flippancy they have earned.
