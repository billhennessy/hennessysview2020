I have two big software projects I've been working--one for work, one on my own.




I'm on vacation all next week, so I should be a bit more prolific.




In the meantime, [Dean](https://www.deanesmay.com), [Steven](https://www.poliblogger.com/), et al, are doing a fine job keeping insanity at bay.




If I don't make it back here, Merry Christmas, everyone.
