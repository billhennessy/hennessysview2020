Struggling to find an answer to the problems of Al Qaeda, the Iraqi insurgents, and terrorists in general? Kill them. Kill them all. Kill them and those who aid and abet. I have no pity for the Iraqis killed by American bombers that took out a terrorist safe house. I pity the children whose criminal parents placed them in harms way, but no one else. (In case you believe the locals who said it was an innocent family home, weapons and bombs that were cached in the house exploded for 20 minutes after the US attack was over.) Terrorists, not coalition airmen, killed the innocents. Or they weren't innocent.  
  
Terrorists wish to win or die. We may either surrender or kill them.![](https://blog.billhennessy.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=749)
