Howard Dean claims that the White House made up the threat against NY and DC financial institutions in order to win votes.  Howard Dean had all of the money, all of the liberal pundits, all of the liberal media, and all of the DNC on his side going into Iowa.  His message earned him not a single delegate until the Vermont primary, where he won 18 votes to 14.    
  
Howard Dean is a stupid man.  Medical education, along with physics, engineering, and business, are the absolute worst studies for human mind.  They narrow its focus rather than broaden it.  Some in those fields work overtime to gain a more liberal education, but very few.  Most are burdened with incorrect notion that their degree means they are right on all matters.  
  
Apparently, Howard Dean wasn't even very good a physician.  He is worse a thinker on things civic.
