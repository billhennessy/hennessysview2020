Well, I was being facetious in my earlier post about Kerry suggesting we simply surrender to Al Qaeda.  But, once again, no matter how ridiculous a conservative tries to be, he can't top the way liberals really think.  
  
John Kerry truly believes we should never had launched a war on terrorism.   He's not backing down on that stand.    
  
Good for him:  it's likely to be his last.  ![](https://blog.billhennessy.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=663)
