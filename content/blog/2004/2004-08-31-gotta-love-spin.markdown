[Howard Fineman used his blog ](https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5810443/)to spin for Kerry today. If I had any money, I'd offer a reward to the first person to find this quote pertaining to Al Gore. Speaking of Kerry, Fineman writes:

Isn't that EXACTLY what they said was wrong with Gore? What we take for indecisivenes, they told us, was actually his deep thinking.




How many more planes would have flown into how many more building while (God forbid) a President Gore or a President Kerry pondered the decisions of how to respond to 9/11? I pray we never find out.
