What can you learn from a serial killer? It's up to you, but David Berkowitz's musings are worth reading.




I was in grade school when the Son of Sam murders captivated the country's imagination. It was an odd time in my life. Saturday Night Live was the most talked about television show. America, by and large, had decided to put Watergate and Vietnam onto the backburner. We were ready to laugh. But David Berkowitz and so many others stood in the wings, drawing us back to ugliness and death. Hard as we tried to break free from misery, suffering, and sickness, they kept pulling us back in.




Redemption is such a beautiful thing. In David Berkowitz's writing, we learn that redemption is available to the worst of us.
