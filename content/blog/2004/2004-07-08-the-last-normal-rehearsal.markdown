Well tonight is the last "normal" rehearsal for Pippin...I have a feeling it's going to be a long one. Not a big deal, though; I'm used to it.  
At the risk of sounding sappy, sentimental, etc. (which really is NOT me at all--maybe deep down, but not a side I generally show to lots of people.), I need to explain some things:  
First, I used to be shy. No, seriously, I was. All through grade school and into my first year and a half at DuBourg, I was shy. I felt kind of like an outcast, a "nerd", label it what you will. Then, I found the Guild. It happened in a weird way: I auditioned because the two girls I carpooled home with were auditioning. Now, I'd been doing little grade school plays (in our school with no theatre, nonethless) since I was 10 or 11, and I was always "on stage" so to speak. It was something I wanted to do, but never had the guts to do until my friends auditioned. Well anyway, I made the show ("Gypsy") and they didn't--they were crushed, I lost two really good friends, it was pretty rough. BUT, the friends (FAMILY) and memories I made in the Guild the next 2 1/2 years FAR surpassed any little tiffs that happened outside.  
Second, I started doing community theatre in October of 2000. I've worked with St. George Theatre Group, KTK, and Family Musical Theatre. (I feel like I'm writing a resume here...) I've made some great friends through these shows, along with some great memories, that I wouldn't trade for the world. But something was missing. And, as "cliche" as it may sound, I think that thing was the closeness of the Guild. When Mr. Leibrecht announced this SAT, I was ecstatic--however, I had a decision to make: audition for this show, or audition for "Into the Woods" with a director I've been working with since my first community theatre show. Obviously, I chose this one. It wasn't an easy decision, but it shouldn't have been as difficult as it was. I was worried my friends I'd made in that group would maybe resent me for "branching out", and lots of other BS excuses. But then I remembered the years, memories, talent, tears, laughter, joy, hard work, and dedication I had spent and loved in the Guild. And the decision was final. And you know what? It's been a "long and winding road", so to speak, but I think I've found it. We've got a really talented, awesome group--let's do it right! Bust your buns everyone!   
(*sigh* ok, so I AM kind of a sap... ;)![](https://blog.billhennessy.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=709)
