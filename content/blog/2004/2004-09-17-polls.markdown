The Gallup organization shows the President has a commanding 13-point lead in its latest poll of likely voters conducted in the past week. A Pew Research Group poll conducted during roughly the same period finds the race a dead heat at 46% to 46%.




The Gallup poll was conducted normally. The Pew people tried something new, by conducting the poll in two phases. Whether that accounts for the difference, I don't know, but somebody is wrong here. Way wrong.




I wonder if CBS had the Pew results certified?
