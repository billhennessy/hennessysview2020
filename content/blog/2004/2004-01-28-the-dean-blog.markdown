These people are great. Funny thing is, I have good scotch and great conversations with people just like this every few weeks. Politics corrupts; Democrat politics corrupts democratically.

WE WILL WIN. KERRY WILL SUCK MY ---. EXCUSE ME. BUSH WILL LOSE. KERRY WILL LOSE.

Dean wins  
Kerry dies  
Bush burns in hell

GO DEAN!

I am a NOBODY BUT DEAN...I used to be an ABB, but no more.

I can not deal with the low-life, slimey politics as exhibited by Kerry. He is politics as usual.

We are politics as different!!

Go Howard....you're THE MAN!!!
