Did you know that in [New York City, only 55% of education budget goes to instruction](https://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/cb_26.htm)?

Did you know that [teacher to pupil ratio is a lousy predictor of education ](https://www.aasa.org/publications/sa/1997_10/achilles_side_research.htm)quality?




Did you know that three of the worst school districts in the country are in the top five in spending per pupil?




Did you know that the quality of education is significantly lower in Blue States than in Red States?
