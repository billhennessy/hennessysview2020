With speech below, listed here in its entirety, the acting career of Ron Silver likely ended.  To Hollywood liberals, freedom of speech extends only to the ends of their perverse, selfish, hateful beliefs.  Tonight, Ron Silver, a liberal Democrat, proudly and bravely crossed the picket line of liberalism and its strike against America.  God bless him.  
______________________________________________  
  
I want to thank the President and the Republican Party for holding this  
event in my hometown, my father's hometown, my grandfather's and great  
grandfather's birthplace.  
   Just over 1,000 days ago, 2,605 of my neighbors were murdered at the World  
Trade Center -- men, women and children -- as they began their day on a  
brilliantly clear New York autumn morning, less than four miles from where I  
am now standing.  
   We will never forgive.  Never forget.  Never excuse!  
   At the end of World War II, General Douglas MacArthur, Supreme Allied  
Commander of the South Pacific, said:  
"It is my earnest hope - indeed the hope of all mankind - that from this  
solemn occasion a better world shall emerge out of the blood and carnage of  
the past, a world found upon faith and understanding, a world dedicated to the  
dignity of man and the fulfillment of his most cherished wish for freedom,  
tolerance and justice."  
   The hope he expressed then remains relevant today.  
   We are again engaged in a war that will define the future of humankind.  
Responding to attacks on our soil, America has led a coalition of countries  
against extremists who want to destroy our way of life and our values.  
   This is a war we did not seek.  
   This is a war waged against us.  
   This is a war to which we had to respond.  
   History shows that we are not imperialists . . .  
but we are fighters for freedom and democracy.  
   Even though I am a well-recognized liberal on many issues confronting our  
society today, I find it ironic that many human rights advocates and outspoken  
members of my own entertainment community are often on the front lines to  
protest repression, for which I applaud them but they are usually the first  
ones to oppose any use of force to take care of these horrors that they  
catalogue repeatedly.  
   Under the unwavering leadership of President Bush, the cause of freedom  
and democracy is being advanced by the courageous men and women serving in our  
Armed Services.  
   The President is doing exactly the right thing.  
   That is why we need this President at this time!  
   I am grateful for the chance to speak tonight to express my support for  
our Commander-in-Chief, for our brave troops, and for the vital cause which  
they have undertaken.  
   General Dwight Eisenhower's statement of 60 years ago is true today . . .  
   "United in this determination and with unshakable faith in the cause for  
which we fight, we will, with God's help, go forward to our greatest victory."  
Thank you.
