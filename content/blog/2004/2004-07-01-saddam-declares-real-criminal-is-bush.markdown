Once upon a time, when I was young and naive, I would have thought such a statement by a mass murderer would only help George Bush.  But the attitudes of my fellow Americans, led by the cowardly liar Michael Moore (please sue me)  has hardened my opinion of my neighbors.  My guess is that this evening's talk shows will host more than a few "mainstream" pundits who will claim Saddam's indictment of Bush proves Moore's case--that Bush is in fact a criminal.  
  
Were the present generation of gutless, wimpy, risk-free Americans around in 1941, Roosevelt would have been impeached and Hitler exhonorated as a victim of FDR's bloodthirsty imperialism.  What a bunch of cowards we are. ![](https://blog.billhennessy.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=728)
