According to the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/31/politics/campaign/31protest.html?ei=5006&en=a9ba78aba9c3fa99&ex=1094616000&partner=ALTAVISTA1&pagewanted=print&position=), the people in New York to stiffle Republic speech, to disrupt the Republican convention, and to increase the chances of harm being done to the Republican President, are making life difficult for both delegates and for NY police. 




I think back to Republican demonstrations in Florida during the 2000 recount. Remember how the major media and every liberal across this great land clamored for harsh punishment for the Republicans? Some, I believe led by Mario Cuomo, asked for federal troops to drive non-Floridians out of the four counties where recounts were then taking place.




Again, to liberals, freedom of speech ends where differing opinions begin. How easy moral choices become when your own personal satisfaction is the only moral imperative.
