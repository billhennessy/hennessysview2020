Jimmy Carter will probably attend Yassir Arafat's funeral service in Cairo, Egypt. How typical of the man who considers the American Revolution a low point in world history.

Yassir Arafat was a tyrant, a murderer, a thief, a shameless self-promoter, a liar, a welcher whose ego killed more Palestinians than all of Israel's weapons. While the UN and its amen chorus denounced Israel's terrorism fence and the poverty Israel supposedly forced upon the Palestinians, Arafat moved hundreds of million of dollars to France--money that might have alleviated Palestinian suffering. Instead of buying a Palestinian child's first pair of shoes, the money bought Arafat's wife her thousandth.

Like the Marcoses in the Philipines, the world will eventually come to see Arafat for what he was: a criminal.

My grandmother used to say, Tell me who you go with, and I'll show you what you are. Jimmy Carter's closest friends are the most evil terrorists and dictators on the planet. His presence at Arafat's funeral will serve as a sign to God that Arafat deserve a special place in Hell.

UPDATE: [Steven Taylor points out ](https://www.poliblogger.com/index.php?p=5293)that Arafat was as irresponsible with Palestinian peace as he was with Palestinian money.
