In a blistering letter to Zell Miller, former president Jimmy Carter--the worst president in 100 years--decries Miller's "unprecedented disloyalty" to the Democrat party.

"By now, there are many of us loyal Democrats who feel uncomfortable in seeing that you have chosen the rich over the poor, unilateral pre-emptive war over a strong nation united with others for peace, lies and obfuscation over the truth and the political technique of character assassination as a way to win elections or to garner a few moments of applause," 

For his part, Miller was polite in response. I think I might have told Mr. Carter that I am uncomfortable seeing him choose North Korea's dictator over the President of the United States, surrender over freedom, criminals over innocents, thugs over democrats just to satisfy his own, unprecedented guilt for having been born to a plantation-owning, Southern, white family.

Calling Miller's speech to the GOP "unprecedented disloyalty" demonstrates Carter's weak grasp on history. Winston Churchill crossed the aisle of the British Parliament during session. Mr. Carter gave Kim Jung Il two American-made nuclear reactors over Bill Clinton's objections and with no authority. The Rosenbergs gave the Soviets the secrets of the atom bomb. Benedict Arnold gave the British the locations of American armies. Yet giving a speech to a political rally is "unprecedented."

What's unprecedented is the liberal respect paid to a blithering idiot like Jimmy Carter.
