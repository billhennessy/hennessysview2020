Liberals want to claim that Blues states house every thinking and tax-paying American in the country. But the Blue states have produced more famous people than liberals might want to acknowledge:   * Timothy McVeigh   * O. J. Simpson    * Ted Bundy    * John Wayne Gacy    * Scott Peterson    * Richard Speck    * Benedict Arnold    * Richard Nixon    * David Berkowitz

I could go on, but you get the point.
