Saddam's capture pushed the Asian and European markets up consistently and strongly, between 1% and 3.5% for all the majors. But in America, people who buy and sell stock are the strangest creatures on earth, and clearly the most in need of instant gratification. From way up to barely a blip, as greedy bastards in $7,000 suits sell, sell, sell at tiny margins to "lock in their profits." 

What a joke. These Wall Street types would sell their mothers and their children for a nickel's profit.
