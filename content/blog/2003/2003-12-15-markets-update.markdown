Well, the President gets more positive coverage with a press conference, the Army announces the arrests of Iraqi resistence leaders based on information contained in documents found with Saddam, and the markets respond by turning down. The Dow, up by more tha 80 points earlier in the day, is at +60, while NASDAQ is just about flat at +2. 

The American investor class knows nothing of patriotism. Sometimes, at seminal moments in history, it is right to subordinate your personal wealth to the national or world good. But the same "me first" monied folks who sold like mad after 9/11--Warren Buffett foremost--are padding their pockets today. Greed and selfishness know no bounds, political, patriotic, or otherwise.
